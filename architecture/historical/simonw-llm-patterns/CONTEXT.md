# Simon Willison LLM Patterns - Pre-Implementation Research

> **HISTORICAL**: This directory contains pre-implementation research for Task 95.

**Status**: Historical - Task 95 completed 2025-12-19

**Purpose**: These documents were created to evaluate and plan the integration of
Simon Willison's `llm` library into pflow's LLM node. They contain:
- Analysis of compatibility with PocketFlow patterns
- Implementation recommendations and patterns
- Code examples showing the proposed approach

**What happened**: Task 95 implemented the llm library integration. These documents
served their purpose during the planning phase and are now preserved for historical
reference.

## Current Implementation

For the actual implementation, see:
- **Implementation**: `src/pflow/nodes/llm/llm.py`
- **Documentation**: `architecture/core-node-packages/llm-nodes.md`
- **Task Review**: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_95/task-review.md`

## Documents in This Directory

- **FINAL-ANALYSIS.md** - Pattern analysis and recommendations (pre-implementation)
- **IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md** - Integration guide with task-specific examples (pre-implementation)
