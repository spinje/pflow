<Update label="December 2024" description="v0.6.0" tags={["New releases"]}>
  ## Initial release

  pflow v0.6.0 — compile agent reasoning into reusable workflows.

  **Workflow engine**
  - Natural language → compiled workflows
  - Save workflows for instant reuse
  - Type-aware templates with auto-parsing and nested access
  - Stdin/stdout pipe integration
  - Validation with suggestions and actionable error messages
  - Execution traces for debugging

  **Built-in nodes**
  - File operations (read, write, copy, move, delete)
  - LLM calls (any model via `llm` library)
  - HTTP requests (all methods, auth, binary support)
  - Shell commands (with dangerous pattern blocking)
  - Claude Code for agentic tasks
  - MCP bridge — connect any MCP server (stdio and HTTP transports)

  **Agent integration**
  - MCP server with 11 tools for workflow building
  - Intelligent discovery of nodes and workflows
  - Run individual nodes without workflows (`registry run`)
  - Structure-only mode — AI sees schema types, not data
  - Instructions system for agent guidance
  - Works with all MCP-compatible and local agents
