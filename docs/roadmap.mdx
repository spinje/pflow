## <Icon icon="circuit-board" size={24} color="#f97316" /> Current status

Where pflow is today:

- **Core workflow engine** built on PocketFlow
- **Node system** — file, llm, http, shell, claude-code, and MCP bridge
- **AI agent integration** via CLI and MCP server
- **Discovery** — find nodes and workflows by describing what you need
- **Template variables** — connect node outputs to inputs
- **Workflow validation** with actionable error messages
- **Execution traces** for debugging
- **Settings management** — API keys, node filtering
- **Unified model support** — use any llm-supported provider for discovery and workflows
- **Batch processing** — process arrays of items through a single node (sequential or parallel)

**Getting pflow into users' hands**

Current focus is preparing for public release:

- Completing user documentation
- Publishing to PyPI for easy installation
- Ensuring a smooth first-run experience

## <Icon icon="lightbulb" size={24} color="#f97316" /> Next

**Model discovery**

- Show available models to agents based on configured API keys
- Help agents select appropriate models for different tasks

**Proving the value**

- Benchmark pflow's efficiency using MCPMark evaluation
- Quantify token savings and latency improvements

**More expressive workflows**

Expanding what workflows can express:

- Conditional branching — if/else logic in workflows
- Task parallelism — run independent nodes concurrently (fan-out/fan-in)
- Nested workflow support

**Better output control**

- Structured output from LLM nodes (JSON schemas)
- Export workflows to standalone Python code
- Execution preview before running

**Safer execution**

- Sandbox runtime for shell commands
- Granular permission boundaries

**Workflows as products**

- Export workflows as self-hosted MCP server packages
- Share automation as installable tools

## <Icon icon="orbit" size={24} color="#f97316" /> Vision

Long-term ideas on the radar:

- Discover and install MCP servers automatically
- Community registry for workflows and MCP servers
- Cloud execution for team use cases
- Workflows exposed as remote HTTP services

These are exploratory — they'll take shape based on feedback and real-world usage.

pflow improves through a direct feedback loop: agents build workflows, we identify where they struggle, we fix it. Because the surface area is finite — node types, template syntax, error messages — each fix compounds.
