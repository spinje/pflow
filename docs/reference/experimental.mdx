These features are available in pflow but considered experimental and/or may be deprecated in the future. They may change, have rough edges, or be replaced in future versions. Use them if they solve a problem for you, but be aware of the caveats.

## Built-in Git and GitHub nodes

pflow includes nodes for Git and GitHub operations, but they're **disabled by default**.

### Recommended alternatives

For most use cases, there are better options:

**Git operations** - Use the `git` CLI directly via [shell node](/reference/nodes/shell). Your agent knows Git extremely well from training data and doesn't need special nodes for common operations.

````markdown
### commit-changes

Stage and commit all changes.

- type: shell

```shell command
git add . && git commit -m '${commit_message}'
```
````

**GitHub operations** - Use the `gh` CLI via shell node for simple tasks, or the [GitHub MCP server](/guides/adding-mcp-servers#github) for complex operations that benefit from structured tools.

````markdown
### create-pr

Create a pull request using the GitHub CLI.

- type: shell

```shell command
gh pr create --title '${title}' --body '${body}'
```
````

### If you still want to try the built-in nodes

Enable with:

```bash
# Enable git nodes
pflow settings allow "pflow.nodes.git.*"

# Enable github nodes
pflow settings allow "pflow.nodes.github.*"
```

Then view available nodes:

```bash
pflow registry list git
pflow registry list github
```

## Natural language planner

pflow has a built-in natural language planner that lets you run commands like:

```bash
pflow "fetch the latest issues from my repo and summarize them"
```
<Note>
  This is **experimental**. Using an external agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) is the recommended approach - it's more capable and provides a better experience. Using your own agents also has the benefit of using a payed subscription instead of paying for every LLM call using API pricing.
</Note>

### When to use it

- Quick one-off tasks when you're not in an AI tool
- Testing or exploring pflow capabilities
- Environments where external agents aren't available

### Debugging planner issues

If you do use the planner and need to debug:

```bash
pflow --trace-planner "your request"
```

This saves the planning process to `~/.pflow/debug/planner-trace-*.json`.

## Auto-repair

pflow can automatically attempt to fix failing workflows using LLM-powered repair. This is **not enabled by default**.

```bash
pflow my-workflow --auto-repair
```

When enabled:
- pflow analyzes the error
- Attempts to fix the workflow
- Retries execution (up to 3 attempts)

### Caveats

- Uses LLM calls (costs money)
- May not fix all issues
- Can get stuck in repair loops on unfixable problems

Your agent doesn't know about this flag - it's for manual experimentation.
