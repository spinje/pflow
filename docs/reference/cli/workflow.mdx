The `pflow workflow` command group manages saved workflows in the global library (`~/.pflow/workflows/`).

<Note>
  **Agent commands.** These commands are primarily used by your AI agent to find and inspect workflows. The `save` command can be used by either you or your agent to persist workflows.
</Note>

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `list` | List all saved workflows |
| `describe` | Show workflow interface details |
| `discover` | Find workflows using natural language |
| `save` | Save a workflow file to the library |

## pflow workflow list

List all saved workflows with optional filtering.

```bash
pflow workflow list [FILTER_PATTERN] [--json]
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILTER_PATTERN` - Optional keywords to filter (space-separated, AND logic)

**Options:**
- `--json` - Output as JSON

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all workflows
pflow workflow list

# Filter by keyword
pflow workflow list github

# Filter by multiple keywords (AND logic)
pflow workflow list "github pr"

# JSON output
pflow workflow list --json
```

**Output:**

Workflows are grouped by category, showing name and description:

```
Saved workflows:

  github:
    - github-pr-review: Review pull requests and suggest improvements
    - github-issue-triage: Categorize and label GitHub issues

  analysis:
    - csv-analyzer: Analyze CSV files and generate reports

Total: 3 workflows
```

## pflow workflow describe

Show detailed information about a workflow including inputs, outputs, and usage.

```bash
pflow workflow describe <NAME>
```

**Arguments:**
- `NAME` - Workflow name (required)

**Example:**

```bash
pflow workflow describe github-pr-review
```

**Output:**

```
Workflow: github-pr-review

Description: Review pull requests and suggest improvements

Inputs:
  - repo (string, required): Repository in owner/repo format
  - pr_number (integer, required): Pull request number
  - focus (string, optional): Areas to focus review on

Outputs:
  - review: Structured review with suggestions
  - summary: Brief summary of findings

Example usage:
  pflow github-pr-review repo=owner/repo pr_number=123
```

<Note>
  If the workflow is not found, pflow suggests similar workflow names.
</Note>

## pflow workflow discover

Use AI to find workflows matching a natural language task description.

```bash
pflow workflow discover "<QUERY>"
```

**Arguments:**
- `QUERY` - Natural language description of what you want to do (max 500 characters)

**Example:**

```bash
pflow workflow discover "I need to analyze pull requests"
```

**Output:**

When a match is found:

```
Found matching workflow: github-pr-review

Match confidence: High
Reasoning: This workflow analyzes PR content and provides structured feedback.

Description: Review pull requests and suggest improvements

Inputs:
  - repo (string, required): Repository in owner/repo format
  - pr_number (integer, required): Pull request number

Example usage:
  pflow github-pr-review repo=owner/repo pr_number=123
```

When no match is found, pflow explains why and lists available workflows.

<Note>
  Requires an API key to be configured. See [Quickstart](/quickstart#set-up-your-api-key) for setup.
</Note>

## pflow workflow save

Save a workflow file to the global library for reuse.

```bash
pflow workflow save <FILE> --name <NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `FILE` - Path to workflow file (`.pflow.md`)

**Required options:**
- `--name NAME` - Workflow name (lowercase, numbers, hyphens only, max 30 chars)

**Optional options:**
- `--force` - Overwrite existing workflow with same name
- `--delete-draft` - Delete source file after successful save

**Examples:**

```bash
# Basic save
pflow workflow save ./workflow.pflow.md --name pr-analyzer

# Overwrite existing workflow
pflow workflow save ./updated.pflow.md --name pr-analyzer --force

# Save and delete draft file
pflow workflow save ./draft.pflow.md --name finalized-workflow --delete-draft
```

**Name format requirements:**
- Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- Maximum 30 characters
- Must be shell-safe and URL-safe

**Output:**

```
✓ Saved workflow: pr-analyzer

Location: ~/.pflow/workflows/pr-analyzer.pflow.md

Inputs:
  - repo (string, required)
  - pr_number (integer, required)

Example usage:
  pflow pr-analyzer repo=owner/repo pr_number=123
```

## Workflow file format

Workflows are markdown files (`.pflow.md`) with a simple structure:

```markdown
# My Workflow

Description of what this workflow does.

## Inputs

### input_name

What this input is for.

- type: string
- required: true

## Steps

### read-data

Read the input file.

- type: read-file
- file_path: ${input_name}

### summarize

Summarize the file contents using AI.

- type: llm
- prompt: Summarize this: ${read-data.content}

## Outputs

### result

Summary of the input file.

- source: ${summarize.response}
```

<Note>
  The workflow title (`# My Workflow`) is the display name. The programmatic name comes from the filename (`my-workflow.pflow.md` → `my-workflow`). Step order determines execution order — no explicit edge declarations needed.
</Note>

## File locations

| Path | Purpose |
