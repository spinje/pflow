The `pflow skill` command group publishes saved workflows as [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills) that AI coding tools can discover and use.

pflow creates symlinks from tool skill directories to your saved workflows, keeping `~/.pflow/workflows/` as the single source of truth.

## Supported tools

| Tool | Project directory | Personal directory |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code (default) | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| Copilot | `.github/skills/` | `~/.copilot/skills/` |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `save` | Publish a workflow as a skill |
| `list` | List all pflow-managed skills |
| `remove` | Remove a skill |

## pflow skill save

Publish a saved workflow as a skill for AI coding tools.

```bash
pflow skill save <WORKFLOW_NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `WORKFLOW_NAME` - Name of a saved workflow (required)

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--personal` | Save to personal directory instead of project |
| `--cursor` | Save to Cursor |
| `--codex` | Save to Codex |
| `--copilot` | Save to Copilot |

By default, saves to Claude Code. Use multiple flags to save to multiple tools at once.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Publish to Claude Code (default)
pflow skill save pr-analyzer

# Publish to Cursor
pflow skill save pr-analyzer --cursor

# Publish to multiple tools
pflow skill save pr-analyzer --cursor --copilot

# Publish to personal directory (cross-project)
pflow skill save pr-analyzer --personal
```

**Output:**

```
Published 'pr-analyzer' to Claude Code (.claude/skills/)
  Symlink: /path/to/project/.claude/skills/pr-analyzer/SKILL.md
  Source:  /Users/you/.pflow/workflows/pr-analyzer.pflow.md
```

Running `save` again on an existing skill updates the enrichment (idempotent):

```
Updated 'pr-analyzer' in Claude Code (.claude/skills/)
  Symlink: /path/to/project/.claude/skills/pr-analyzer/SKILL.md
  Source:  /Users/you/.pflow/workflows/pr-analyzer.pflow.md
```

<Accordion title="What happens during save">
  When you run `pflow skill save`, two things happen:

  1. **Workflow enrichment** - pflow adds a `## Usage` section to your workflow file with instructions for AI agents, and adds `name` and `description` fields to the frontmatter.

  2. **Symlink creation** - pflow creates a `SKILL.md` symlink in the tool's skill directory pointing to your workflow file.

  The enrichment is idempotent - running save multiple times just updates the `## Usage` section.
</Accordion>

## pflow skill list

List all pflow-managed skills across all tools.

```bash
pflow skill list
```

**Output:**

```
pflow skills:

  pr-analyzer
    → Claude Code (project)
    → Cursor (project)

  data-processor
    → Claude Code (personal)
```

If a skill's source workflow was deleted, the list shows it as a broken link with fix instructions:

```
pflow skills:

  old-workflow
    → Claude Code (project) [broken link]

Broken link: the source workflow 'old-workflow' was deleted.
  To restore: pflow workflow save <file> --name old-workflow --force
  To remove:  pflow skill remove old-workflow
```

## pflow skill remove

Remove a workflow's skill from tool directories.

```bash
pflow skill remove <WORKFLOW_NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

**Arguments:**
- `WORKFLOW_NAME` - Name of the skill to remove (required)

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--personal` | Remove from personal directory instead of project |
| `--cursor` | Remove from Cursor |
| `--codex` | Remove from Codex |
| `--copilot` | Remove from Copilot |

By default, removes from Claude Code. Use multiple flags to remove from multiple tools.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Remove from Claude Code (default)
pflow skill remove pr-analyzer

# Remove from Cursor
pflow skill remove pr-analyzer --cursor

# Remove from multiple tools
pflow skill remove pr-analyzer --cursor --copilot

# Remove from personal directory
pflow skill remove pr-analyzer --personal
```

**Output:**

```
Removed skill 'pr-analyzer' from Claude Code (.claude/skills/)
```

<Note>
  Removing a skill only deletes the symlink. The saved workflow in `~/.pflow/workflows/` is unchanged, including any enrichment added during `skill save`.
</Note>

## Workflow requirements

Before publishing a workflow as a skill, you must save it to the global library:

```bash
# First, save the workflow
pflow workflow save ./my-workflow.pflow.md --name my-workflow

# Then publish as a skill
pflow skill save my-workflow
```

## Project vs personal skills

**Project skills** (default) are stored in the current project directory and are typically version-controlled with your project. Use these for project-specific workflows.

**Personal skills** (`--personal`) are stored in your home directory and are available across all projects. Use these for general-purpose workflows you want everywhere.
