<Note>
  **Agent commands.** Your AI agent uses this node in workflows. You manage the MCP servers that provide these tools with [`pflow mcp`](/reference/cli/mcp) commands.
</Note>

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets you extend pflow with external tools. When you add an MCP server, its tools become pflow nodes — same validation, same error handling, same template access as built-in nodes.

## How it works

1. **Add an MCP server** with `pflow mcp add`
2. **Sync tools** with `pflow mcp sync` (or let auto-sync handle it)
3. **Tools become nodes** named `mcp-{server}-{tool}`
4. **Agent uses them** like any other node

```bash
# Add a GitHub MCP server
pflow mcp add github.mcp.json

# Tools are now available
pflow mcp tools github
# mcp-github-create_issue
# mcp-github-list_repos
# mcp-github-search_code
```

## Node naming

MCP tools become nodes with the pattern `mcp-{server}-{tool}`:

| Server | Tool | Node name |
|--------|------|-----------|
| github | create_issue | `mcp-github-create_issue` |
| slack | send_message | `mcp-slack-send_message` |
| filesystem | read_file | `mcp-filesystem-read_file` |

## Parameters

MCP node parameters come directly from the tool's input schema. Each MCP server defines its own tools with their own parameters.

To see a tool's parameters:

```bash
pflow registry describe mcp-github-create_issue
```

## Output

All MCP nodes write to:

| Key | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `result` | any | Tool execution result |
| `{server}_{tool}_result` | any | Same result with unique key |
| `error` | str | Error message (only on failure) |

For dict results, top-level fields are also extracted directly:

If a tool returns `{"issue_url": "...", "issue_number": 123}`, the shared store contains:

```json
{
  "result": {"issue_url": "...", "issue_number": 123},
  "github_create_issue_result": {"issue_url": "...", "issue_number": 123},
  "issue_url": "...",
  "issue_number": 123
}
```

## Example workflow

```markdown
### create_issue

Create a GitHub issue from the error summary.

- type: mcp-github-create_issue
- repository: myorg/myrepo
- title: "Bug: ${error_summary}"
- body: ${error_details}

### notify

Send a Slack notification with the issue link.

- type: mcp-slack-send_message
- channel: "#alerts"
- text: "Created issue: ${create_issue.issue_url}"
```

## Setup

To use MCP tools, first add MCP servers to pflow. See [Adding MCP servers](/guides/adding-mcp-servers) for configuration format, authentication, and examples.

pflow supports both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP) MCP servers. Both work identically in workflows - same naming, parameters, and output structure.

## Error handling

MCP nodes return `error` action on:

- **Connection failure**: Server not reachable
- **Tool error**: Tool reported an error (via `isError` flag)
- **Timeout**: Request took too long (default 30 seconds)

The node does **not** retry automatically - MCP calls start a server subprocess, and retries would cause resource conflicts.

## Auto-sync

When you run a workflow, pflow automatically syncs MCP tools if the server configuration has changed. You don't need to manually run `pflow mcp sync` after adding servers.

Manual sync is useful for:
- Testing connection immediately after adding a server
- Debugging connection issues
- Forcing re-discovery without running a workflow
