pflow is a workflow compiler for AI agents. Your agent reasons through a task once, pflow compiles it into a workflow, and that workflow runs instantly forever after - no re-planning, no repeated costs.

## The problem

AI agents are powerful but inefficient for repetitive tasks:

- **Re-reasoning**: Every time you ask an agent to do the same task, it reasons through it from scratch
- **Cost**: Each reasoning pass costs tokens - the same tokens, for the same logic, every time
- **Inconsistency**: Agents might take different paths or skip steps on different runs
- **Context bloat**: Loading tool schemas (especially MCP servers) consumes tokens before any work begins

## How pflow helps

pflow separates planning from execution:

1. **Your agent plans once** - it figures out what nodes to use and how to connect them
2. **pflow compiles the workflow** - saves it as a deterministic, reusable pipeline
3. **Execution is instant** - run the same workflow with different inputs, zero reasoning cost

Your agent uses pflow's intelligent discovery to find only the tools it needs - no loading hundreds of MCP tool schemas into context.

## Two ways to run workflows

**Agent-driven**: Your AI agent discovers, creates, and runs workflows through pflow. This is the primary flow - your agent handles automation tasks using workflows it has built.

**Direct CLI**: Saved workflows are CLI commands. Run them directly in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or cron jobs - no agent needed.

```bash
# Agent builds this once, then anyone can run it
pflow analyze-logs input=./logs/api.log format=json
```
