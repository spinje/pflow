pflow is a workflow compiler for AI agents. Your agent reasons through a task once, pflow compiles it into a workflow, and that workflow runs instantly forever after — no re-planning, no repeated costs. Like shell scripts, but for AI operations.

## The problem

AI agents re-reason through every task from scratch, even ones they've solved before:

- **Inconsistency**: Agents take different paths or skip steps between runs — there's no way to verify without watching
- **Cost**: Each reasoning pass costs tokens — the same tokens, for the same logic, every time
- **Context bloat**: Loading tool schemas (especially MCP servers) consumes tokens before any work begins

## How pflow helps

pflow separates planning from execution:

1. **Your agent plans once** - figures out what nodes to use and how to connect them
2. **pflow compiles the workflow** - saves it as a reusable `.pflow.md` file
3. **Execution is instant** - run the same workflow with different inputs, zero reasoning cost

Nodes are individual tools (call an LLM or API, read a file, or any MCP tool). Workflows chain them together. Save a workflow and your agent can discover it later, reuse it with different inputs, or chain it into a larger workflow.

## Workflows are documentation

A pflow workflow is a `.pflow.md` file — a standard markdown document that happens to be executable. Headings describe inputs and steps. Prose explains intent. Code blocks contain the actual commands, prompts, and configuration.

The format is markdown because that's what agents naturally produce — headings, YAML, code blocks. No framework to learn, no class hierarchy, no imports.

Open one on GitHub and it reads like documentation. Run it with pflow and it runs as a workflow. Same file, both purposes. No separate documentation to maintain, no opaque config to decipher — the workflow explains itself.

## Two ways to run workflows

**Agent-driven**: Your AI agent discovers, creates, and runs workflows through pflow. This is how most people use pflow — your agent handles automation using workflows it has built.

**Direct CLI**: Saved workflows are CLI commands. Run them directly in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or cron jobs - no agent needed.

```bash
# Agent builds this once, then anyone can run it
pflow analyze-logs input=./logs/api.log format=json
```
