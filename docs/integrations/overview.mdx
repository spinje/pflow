<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Before you begin, [install pflow](/quickstart) and set up your API key.
</Info>

pflow works with any AI tool that has terminal access or supports MCP servers. Choose your tool below for setup instructions.

## Two ways to connect

### CLI access

If your AI tool has terminal access (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf), the simplest approach is CLI access. Your agent runs pflow commands directly:

```bash
pflow instructions usage
```

This gives the agent everything it needs to discover workflows, run them, and build new ones.

### MCP server

For tools that support the Model Context Protocol, you can add pflow as an MCP server. This gives your agent structured tools for workflow operations.

The MCP config for pflow is the same across all tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pflow": {
      "command": "pflow",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Same capabilities, different interface

Both methods give your agent the same functionality - the MCP server mirrors the CLI commands with minor adjustments for structured tool use. Your agent can discover nodes, run workflows, save new ones, and manage settings either way.

Choose based on what your AI tool supports. If it has terminal access, CLI is simpler. If it only supports MCP, use that. If it supports both, either works.

## Comparison

| Tool | CLI access | MCP server | One-click install |
|------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | Yes | Yes | - |
| Claude Desktop | No | Yes | No |
| Cursor | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| VS Code / Copilot | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Windsurf | Yes | Yes | No |

<Note>
pflow is currently verified to work on macOS. Windows and Linux support is coming soon.
