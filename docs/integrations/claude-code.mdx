Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI agent with full terminal access. You can connect pflow using CLI commands or as an MCP server.

## Option 1: CLI access (recommended)

Since Claude Code has terminal access, the simplest approach is to tell it to use pflow directly.

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md` or system instructions:

```markdown
Use pflow for workflow automation. Run `pflow instructions usage` to learn the commands.
```

Claude Code will then run pflow commands directly when it needs to build or execute workflows.

## Option 2: MCP server

You can also add pflow as an MCP server for structured tool access.

Run this command in Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add pflow -- pflow mcp serve
```

Or add manually to your MCP config:

```bash
claude mcp add pflow --command pflow --args "mcp,serve"
```

### Verify installation

Check that pflow is configured:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `pflow` in the list of configured servers.

## Which should I use?

**CLI access** is simpler and recommended for most users. Claude Code can run any pflow command directly.

**MCP server** is useful if you want Claude Code to have structured tools for workflow operations, or if you're using pflow with other MCP servers.

Both approaches give Claude Code the same capabilities - discovering workflows, running them, and building new ones.
