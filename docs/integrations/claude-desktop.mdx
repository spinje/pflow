<Info>
**Prerequisites:** [Install pflow](/quickstart) before continuing.
</Info>

Claude Desktop connects to pflow via MCP server. This gives Claude access to pflow's workflow discovery and execution tools.

<Note>
pflow is currently verified to work on macOS. Windows and Linux support is coming soon.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your MCP config file">
    The config file is located at:

    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```

    You can also access it through Claude Desktop: **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add pflow to your config">
    Add the pflow server to your `mcpServers` object:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pflow": {
          "command": "pflow",
          "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you have other MCP servers configured, add pflow alongside them:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "existing-server": {
          "command": "...",
          "args": ["..."]
        },
        "pflow": {
          "command": "pflow",
          "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Completely quit Claude Desktop and restart it. The app needs to restart to load the new MCP server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Start a new conversation and ask Claude to list available pflow workflows:

    ```
    Use pflow to list available workflows
    ```

    Claude should be able to access pflow's tools and respond with workflow information.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Claude doesn't see pflow tools">
  1. Make sure pflow is installed and in your PATH: `pflow --version`
  2. Check your JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator)
  3. Completely quit and restart Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Config file doesn't exist">
  Open Claude Desktop, go to **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**. Claude will create the file for you.
</Accordion>
