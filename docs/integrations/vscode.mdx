<Info>
**Prerequisites:** [Install pflow](/quickstart) before continuing.
</Info>

VS Code with GitHub Copilot supports MCP servers for extended AI capabilities. You can add pflow with one-click install or manual setup.

## One-click install

Click the button below to add pflow to VS Code:

<a href="vscode:mcp/install?name=pflow&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22stdio%22%2C%20%22command%22%3A%20%22pflow%22%2C%20%22args%22%3A%20%5B%22mcp%22%2C%20%22serve%22%5D%7D">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_pflow-0098FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white" alt="Install pflow in VS Code" />
</a>

If the button doesn't work, use the web redirect:

<a href="https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=pflow&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%20%22stdio%22%2C%20%22command%22%3A%20%22pflow%22%2C%20%22args%22%3A%20%5B%22mcp%22%2C%20%22serve%22%5D%7D">
  Install via vscode.dev
</a>

## Manual setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your MCP config file">
    **User config** (all projects): `~/.vscode/mcp.json`

    **Workspace config** (single project): `.vscode/mcp.json`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add pflow to your config">
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pflow": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "pflow",
          "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reload VS Code">
    Reload the window or restart VS Code to load the new MCP server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify installation

Ask Copilot to list pflow workflows:

```
Use pflow to list available workflows
```

Copilot should be able to access pflow's tools and respond with workflow information.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="One-click install didn't work">
  1. Make sure VS Code is installed and the `vscode:` protocol handler is registered
  2. Try the web redirect link instead
  3. Fall back to manual setup
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Copilot doesn't see pflow tools">
  1. Make sure pflow is installed and in your PATH: `pflow --version`
  2. Check your MCP config JSON syntax is valid
  3. Reload VS Code window
</Accordion>
