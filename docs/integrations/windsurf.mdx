Windsurf supports both CLI access and MCP servers. Since Windsurf has terminal access, you can use either approach.

## Option 1: CLI access (simplest)

Windsurf has terminal access, so the simplest approach is to use pflow via CLI. Tell Windsurf:

```
Use pflow for workflow automation. Run `pflow instructions usage` to learn the commands.
```

Windsurf will then run pflow commands directly when it needs to build or execute workflows.

## Option 2: MCP server

You can also add pflow as an MCP server for structured tool access.

### 1. Open your MCP config file

The config file is located at:

```
~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
```

Create the file if it doesn't exist.

### 2. Add pflow to your config

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pflow": {
      "command": "pflow",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Windsurf

Restart Windsurf to load the new MCP server.

## Verify installation

Ask Windsurf to list pflow workflows:

```
Use pflow to list available workflows
```

Windsurf should be able to access pflow's tools and respond with workflow information.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Windsurf doesn't see pflow tools">
  1. Make sure pflow is installed and in your PATH: `pflow --version`
  2. Check your MCP config JSON syntax is valid
  3. Make sure the config file is at `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`
  4. Restart Windsurf
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Config file location on different OS">
  The config path `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` is for macOS/Linux. On Windows, check Windsurf documentation for the equivalent path.
