Cursor supports both CLI access and MCP servers. The easiest way to get started is with one-click install.

## One-click install

Click the button below to add pflow to Cursor:

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=pflow&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoicGZsb3ciLCJhcmdzIjpbIm1jcCIsInNlcnZlIl19">
  <img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg" alt="Install pflow in Cursor" />
</a>

This adds pflow as an MCP server to your global Cursor config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`).

## Manual setup

If you prefer to set up manually, you have two options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="MCP server">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add pflow to your config">
        **Global config** (all projects): `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

        **Project config** (single project): `.cursor/mcp.json`

        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "pflow": {
              "command": "pflow",
              "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        You can also add via Cursor settings: **File** → **Preferences** → **Cursor Settings** → **MCP**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Verify installation">
        Open Cursor settings (**File** → **Preferences** → **Cursor Settings** → **MCP**) and check that pflow appears in the list of configured servers.

        Or ask Cursor to list pflow workflows:

        ```
        Use pflow to list available workflows
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CLI access">
    Since Cursor has terminal access, you can also use pflow via CLI. Add to your project's instructions or tell Cursor:

    ```
    Use pflow for workflow automation. Run `pflow instructions usage` to learn the commands.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="One-click install didn't work">
  The deeplink requires Cursor to be installed and registered as a protocol handler. Try manual setup instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cursor doesn't see pflow tools">
  1. Make sure pflow is installed and in your PATH: `pflow --version`
  2. Check your MCP config JSON syntax is valid
  3. Restart Cursor
</Accordion>

## Publishing workflows as skills

You can publish saved workflows as Cursor skills:

```bash
pflow skill save my-workflow --cursor
```

This creates a symlink in `.cursor/skills/my-workflow/SKILL.md` pointing to your workflow.

For personal skills available across all projects:

```bash
pflow skill save my-workflow --cursor --personal
```

See [pflow skill](/reference/cli/skill) for full documentation.
