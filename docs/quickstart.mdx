Your AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) uses pflow to build and run workflows. You install it, configure an API key, and your agent handles the rest.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/)
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install pflow">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="uv (recommended)">
        ```bash
        uv tool install pflow-cli
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="pipx">
        ```bash
        pipx install pflow-cli
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Verify installation:

    ```bash
    pflow --version
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your API key">
    pflow uses an LLM for **discovery** — finding the right workflows and nodes without your agent needing to load everything into context. You can use any provider supported by [Simon Willison's llm](https://llm.datasette.io/).

    ```bash
    # OpenAI
    pflow settings set-env OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-..."

    # Or Anthropic
    pflow settings set-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-..."

    # Or Google
    pflow settings set-env GEMINI_API_KEY "..."
    ```

    pflow auto-detects your provider and selects a default model (Claude Sonnet 4.5 for Anthropic, Gemini 3 Flash for Google, GPT-5.2 for OpenAI).

    <Tip>
    If you already have `llm` installed and configured (`llm keys set openai`), pflow will use those keys automatically.
    </Tip>

    <Accordion title="Choose a specific model (optional)">
      To use a different model than the auto-detected default:

      ```bash
      pflow settings llm set-default claude-sonnet-4-5
      ```

      See [LLM model settings](/reference/cli/settings#llm-model-settings) for all options.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What the model is used for">
      This is **pflow's LLM configuration**, separate from whatever LLM your agent uses:

      - **Discovery commands** - `pflow registry discover` and `pflow workflow discover` use LLM to find relevant nodes and workflows
      - **LLM nodes** - workflows that include an LLM node for text processing
      - **Smart filtering** - automatic field selection for large API responses

      <Note>
      Your agent creates workflows using its own LLM (Claude Code uses Claude, Cursor uses its models, etc.). pflow's model configuration is only for pflow's internal features.
      </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="When is it required?">
      Set up an LLM if you're using MCP servers. MCP tool descriptions can consume a third of your agent's context before any work starts — discovery is how pflow avoids that.

      For basic usage without MCP servers or testing pflow, the configuration is optional.

      <Tip>
      Discovery costs a fraction of what your agent spends per task. By loading only what's relevant, it cuts token usage, speeds up responses, and keeps context focused.
      </Tip>
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect pflow to your AI agent">
    Your AI agent can use pflow in two ways:

    **Option 1: CLI access (easiest)**

    If your agent has terminal access (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf), instruct it to run:

    ```bash
    pflow instructions usage
    ```

    This gives the agent everything it needs to discover existing workflows, run them, or build new ones.

    **Option 2: MCP server**

    Add pflow to your AI tool's MCP config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.):

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pflow": {
          "command": "pflow",
          "args": ["mcp", "serve"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    See [AI tool integration](/integrations/overview) for detailed setup instructions for each tool.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What your agent can do with pflow

Once connected, your agent can:

- **Discover workflows**: `pflow workflow discover "what I want to do"`
- **Run workflows**: `pflow my-workflow param1=value1`
- **List workflows**: `pflow workflow list`
- **Discover nodes**: `pflow registry discover "capability I need"`
- **Build new workflows**: Following `pflow instructions create`

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Command not found: pflow">
  Make sure the install location is in your PATH:

  ```bash
  # For uv
  echo $PATH | grep -q "$HOME/.local/bin" || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

  # For pipx
  pipx ensurepath
  ```

  Then restart your terminal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Python version error">
  pflow requires Python 3.10+. Check your version:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  If you need to upgrade, use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or your system package manager.
