pflow workflows can be published as [Agent Skills](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills). Skills are loaded automatically when your AI agent starts — no need to run `pflow workflow list` or `pflow workflow discover`. Your agent just knows the skill exists and can use it.

When you publish a workflow as a skill, pflow creates a symlink from the tool's skill directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/`) to your saved workflow. Your workflow stays in `~/.pflow/workflows/` as the single source of truth, and updates automatically appear in all linked skills.

## Publishing a workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save your workflow">
    Make sure your workflow is saved to the library:
    ```bash
    pflow workflow save ./my-workflow.pflow.md --name my-workflow
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish as a skill">
    ```bash
    pflow skill save my-workflow
    ```
    This creates a symlink at `.claude/skills/my-workflow/SKILL.md` and enriches your workflow with usage instructions for your agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  By default, skills are saved to the **project directory** (`.claude/skills/`). Use `--personal` for skills you want available across all projects.
</Note>

## Publishing to multiple tools

Publish to different AI tools using flags:

```bash
# Publish to Cursor
pflow skill save my-workflow --cursor

# Publish to multiple tools at once
pflow skill save my-workflow --cursor --copilot
```

See [supported tools](/reference/cli/skill#supported-tools) for all available targets.

## Project vs personal skills

**Project skills** (default) live in your project directory and are typically committed to version control. Team members who clone the repo get the same skills.

**Personal skills** live in your home directory and are available across all projects:

```bash
pflow skill save my-workflow --personal
```

## Managing skills

List all skills:

```bash
pflow skill list
```

Remove a skill:

```bash
pflow skill remove my-workflow
```

See [pflow skill reference](/reference/cli/skill) for all options including `--cursor`, `--copilot`, and `--personal` flags.

## How enrichment works

When you publish a skill, pflow adds a `## Usage` section to your workflow with instructions for your agent, including how to run it and how to check execution history:

```
pflow my-workflow param1=<value>
pflow workflow history my-workflow
```

This enrichment is **idempotent** — running `skill save` again just updates the usage section. When you update a workflow with `pflow workflow save --force`, pflow automatically re-enriches it.

## Best practices

**Publish stable workflows.** Skills are meant for workflows you want to reuse. Publish once a workflow is working reliably.

**Use project skills for team workflows.** Commit `.claude/skills/` to version control so your team shares the same automation.

**Use personal skills sparingly.** Reserve these for truly universal workflows you want everywhere.
