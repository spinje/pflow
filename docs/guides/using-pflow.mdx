Once pflow is installed and connected to your AI tool, you don't need to learn anything else. Your agent has everything it needs to build and run workflows.

## You don't need to learn the schema

pflow workflows are JSON files with a specific structure - but you'll never need to write one manually. Your agent:

- Reads pflow's instructions automatically
- Knows which nodes are available
- Understands how to connect them
- Handles all the technical details
- Creates, updates and reuses workflows for you

You just describe what you want in natural language. Your agent does the rest.

## Your agent guides you when needed

When pflow needs something from you, your agent will tell you exactly what to do.

**Need an API key?**

> Your agent: "pflow needs an Anthropic API key for intelligent discovery. Run this command: `pflow settings set-env ANTHROPIC_API_KEY 'your-key'`"

**Need to connect to an API?**

> Your agent reads the documentation and builds the integration for you using the [http node](/reference/nodes/http).

**Need an MCP server?**

> Your agent helps you find and install it with your permission.

<Tip>
If you're calling the same API repeatedly, consider having your agent create an MCP server for it - turning one-off requests into reusable tools.
</Tip>

**Something unexpected happen?**

> Your agent diagnoses the issue using pflow's structured errors and traces. See [How debugging works](/guides/debugging) for details.

You don't need to memorize *any* commands. Your agent knows them and will prompt you when necessary.

## What happens behind the scenes

When you ask your agent to do something:

1. **Agent checks for existing workflows** - If you've done this task before, pflow finds the saved workflow
2. **Runs instantly if found** - No re-planning, no LLM costs, same reliable result
3. **Updates existing workflow if it needs to be modified** - Agent updates it with new functionality or parameters
4. **Builds new workflow if needed** - Agent creates it once, pflow saves it for next time

Over time, your workflow library grows. Tasks that used to require agent reasoning become instant commands.

## Not everything needs a workflow

Sometimes you just need to run a single tool - send a Slack message, fetch a file, query an API. Your agent can run individual nodes directly without building a workflow:

```bash
pflow registry run mcp-slack-SEND_MESSAGE channel="general" text="Done!"
```

This is useful for:
- **One-off tasks** - No workflow needed, just run the tool
- **Testing** - Your agent tests nodes to understand their output before building workflows

Think of nodes as individual building blocks. Your agent can use them standalone or compose them into workflows - whatever fits the task.

## Checking your workflow library

To see what workflows have been saved:

```bash
pflow workflow list
```

To see details about a specific workflow:

```bash
pflow workflow describe my-workflow
```

See [workflow commands](/reference/cli/workflow) for more options.

## Optional: Running workflows directly

You don't *have to* go through your agent. Saved workflows are CLI commands you can run yourself:

```bash
# Run a saved workflow
pflow analyze-logs input=./logs/api.log

# Use in a script
cat data.csv | pflow --output-format json process-csv > output.json

# Schedule with cron
0 9 * * * pflow daily-report >> ~/reports/daily.md
```

This is useful for:
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Run workflows as build steps
- **Cron jobs** - Schedule recurring tasks
- **Scripts** - Chain workflows with other tools

See [CLI overview](/reference/cli/index) for all options.

## Summary

| Task | Who handles it |
|------|----------------|
| Learning pflow commands | Your agent |
| Writing workflow JSON | Your agent |
| Knowing which nodes exist | Your agent |
| Configuring API keys | You (agent tells you the command) |
| Discovering new capabilities | Your agent or you  |
| Installing new MCP servers | Your agent or you  |
| Running saved workflows | Your agent or you directly |

pflow is designed to stay out of your way. Your agent handles the complexity - you just describe what you want done. Think of pflow as the infrastructure that makes this scalable - turning automation into reusable building blocks that are discoverable, composable, and ready for your agent to use again and again.
