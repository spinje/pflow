# Knowledge Synthesis for [Task/Subtask ID]

*Created: [Date]*

## Purpose
Synthesize all relevant learnings from previous implementations to inform the refinement and implementation of [Task ID].

## Relevant Patterns from Previous Tasks

### Pattern: [Pattern Name]
- **Source**: Task [X.Y]
- **What it does**: [Brief description]
- **Why it's relevant**: [How it applies to current task]
- **Code example**:
```[language]
[Snippet showing the pattern]
```

### Pattern: [Another Pattern]
- **Source**: Task [X.Y]
- **What it does**: [...]
- **Why it's relevant**: [...]

## Known Pitfalls to Avoid

### Pitfall: [What went wrong]
- **Source**: Task [X.Y] failed when...
- **Root cause**: [Why it failed]
- **How to avoid**: [Specific guidance]
- **Alternative approach**: [What to do instead]

## Established Conventions

### Convention: [Convention name]
- **Decided in**: Task [X.Y]
- **Rule**: [The convention to follow]
- **Example**: [Show the convention in practice]
- **Must maintain because**: [Why this matters]

## Codebase Evolution Context

### Change: [What was added/modified]
- **When**: Task [X.Y]
- **What changed**: [Specific changes]
- **Impact on current task**: [How this affects what we're doing]

### Architecture Decision: [Decision name]
- **Made in**: Task [X.Y]
- **Decision**: [What was decided]
- **Rationale**: [Why]
- **Constraints for us**: [What we must respect]

## Dependencies and Assumptions

### From Previous Tasks
- Task [X.Y] assumes [assumption] - **Status**: [Still valid? Changed?]
- Task [A.B] depends on [dependency] - **Impact**: [How it affects us]

## Recommended Approach

Based on accumulated knowledge:
1. **Start with**: [Recommended first step based on patterns]
2. **Use**: [Specific pattern or approach that's proven]
3. **Avoid**: [Specific pitfall to watch for]
4. **Follow**: [Convention to maintain]

## Questions to Investigate

Based on previous learnings, verify:
- [ ] Does [assumption from Task X.Y] still hold?
- [ ] Is [pattern Z] still the best approach given [change]?
- [ ] Has [dependency] been modified since Task [A.B]?
