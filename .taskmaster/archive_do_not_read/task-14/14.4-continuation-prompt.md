I need to update the metadata extraction documentation at `architecture/implementation-details/metadata-extraction.md` to reflect the enhanced Interface format implementation from Task 14.

I have a detailed handoff document at `scratchpads/task-14/14.4-handoff-final.md` that explains:
- The parser changes from subtask 14.3 (multi-line support, comma-aware splitting)
- New methods added for enhanced format parsing
- Parser limitations discovered during testing
- What needs to be documented

The enhanced format is already fully specified in `architecture/reference/enhanced-interface-format.md`. The metadata extractor code is in `src/pflow/registry/metadata_extractor.py`.

Please update the metadata-extraction.md document to:
1. Explain both simple and enhanced formats
2. Document the parser implementation details
3. Include the exclusive params pattern
4. List known limitations
5. Show how metadata flows to the context builder

This is the final piece of subtask 14.4.
