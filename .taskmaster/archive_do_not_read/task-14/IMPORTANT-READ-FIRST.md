# IMPORTANT: Read Instructions First

## For the Next Agent

You have been provided with comprehensive documentation about subtask 14.1 implementation in this folder:

1. **`scratchpads/task-14/subtask-14.1-comprehensive-braindump.md`** - Complete context about what you're implementing
2. **`scratchpads/task-14/subtask-14.1-implementation-plan.md`** - Step-by-step implementation guide

## YOUR FIRST STEPS:

1. **READ** both documents carefully to understand:
   - What subtask 14.1 is about (Enhanced Interface Parser)
   - The current state (partially implemented with a bug)
   - The critical decisions already made
   - The implementation plan

2. **DO NOT START IMPLEMENTING YET**

3. **WAIT for user instructions** after reading

The implementation is partially complete but has a bug that needs fixing first. The documents contain all the context you need to understand the situation.

## Why This Matters

The previous agent's context window was full, so all the critical information has been preserved in these documents. You need to read them to understand:
- What's already been done
- What bug needs fixing
- What still needs to be implemented
- All the gotchas and critical details

**After reading, acknowledge that you understand and wait for the user to give you specific instructions.**
