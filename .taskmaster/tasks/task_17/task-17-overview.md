# Task 17: Natural Language Planner - Document Overview

This document synthesizes key insights from research files to provide actionable implementation guidance for the Natural Language Planner System. It complements the ambiguities document by providing concrete architectural decisions and implementation patterns.

## Getting Started

Task 17: Natural Language Planner - Context and Implementation Details

> **First step:** Read these core docs *in full* and make sure you deeply understand them:
>
> * `scratchpads/critical-user-decisions/task-17-planner-ambiguities.md`
> * `.taskmaster/tasks/task_17/task-17-architecture-and-patterns.md`
> * `.taskmaster/tasks/task_17/task-17-implementation-guide.md`
> * `.taskmaster/tasks/task_17/task-17-core-concepts.md`

## Document Structure

This document has been split into three focused files for better organization:

1. **task-17-architecture-and-patterns.md** - Core architecture, design patterns, and anti-patterns
   - Meta-workflow architecture with two paths
   - PocketFlow usage rationale
   - Advanced implementation patterns
   - Comprehensive anti-patterns list

2. **task-17-implementation-guide.md** - Implementation details, code examples, and integration
   - LLM integration with structured output
   - Prompt templates and context building
   - Testing strategies
   - Concrete integration examples

3. **task-17-core-concepts.md** - Critical concepts, constraints, and decision rationale
   - Template variable system and constraints
   - Parameter extraction as verification
   - Risk mitigation strategies
   - Success metrics

All content from the original document is preserved across these files.
