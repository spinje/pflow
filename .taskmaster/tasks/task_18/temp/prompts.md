can you just take a step back and evaluate if your understanding is absolute correct. read this first pocketflow/__init__.py and     │
│   ultrathink. another thing we might need to consider here is that template variables should be resolved by shared store values,       │
│   these will be updated as the flow progresses and should be resolved just before the node is executed. This is possible... right?     │
│   its very important we consider everything here

Why should proxy mappings and template variables not be implemented like this?
