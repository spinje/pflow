Should I support:

pipx install "yourpkg @ git+https://github.com/ORG/REPO.git@v0.3.1"

instead of:

pipx install git+https://github.com/spinje/pflow.git

is making yourpkg required anyway for releasing to PyPI?

What is the uv tool install command for this?

Is this unnecessary overhead if we are releasing to PyPI anyway?
