# Task Impact Analysis

## Discovery
Subtask 6.1 implementation included functionality planned for subtask 6.2 (validation functions). This natural combination follows the "test-as-you-go" pattern and resulted in a more cohesive implementation.

## Affects
- **Subtask 6.2**: Already completed as part of 6.1
  - validate_ir() function implemented
  - Custom ValidationError with helpful messages implemented
  - JSON loading with error handling implemented
  - Comprehensive tests already written

- **Subtask 6.3**: Can proceed normally
  - Still needs additional examples beyond what's in tests
  - Module documentation could be enhanced
  - Error message polishing based on more examples

## Action Required
- [ ] Mark subtask 6.2 as done since functionality is complete
- [ ] Subtask 6.3 remains valid and should focus on examples/documentation
