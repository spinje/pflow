can you update the prompt you were given to reference the existing state and the file you just created, think hard how to update
   this prompt for the next agent
     (continuing in your place) prompt: .taskmaster/tasks/task_19/task-19-implementation-prompt.md remember to mention
  .taskmaster/tasks/task_19/implementation/comprehensive-plan.md
  .taskmaster/tasks/task_19/implementation/progress-log.md (emphasize that the agent needs to read all the files (the ones
  suggested by the original prompt as well, before it begins (continues where you left off)

   CRITICAL UPDATE: you are running out of context window, I need you to braindump what you are doing, why it is important and
  EVERY detail that is relevant to
    what you are doing to a COMPREHENSIVE file in the scratchpad folder. Your memory is going to be reset, you will need a
  comprehensive document to get you back
    on track on EXACTLY what you are doing. include references to any relevant files. Outline EXACTLY what you have done so far
  and what you are going to do next
    (what is left to do)
