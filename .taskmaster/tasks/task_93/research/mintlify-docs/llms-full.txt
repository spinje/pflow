Learn how AI enhances reading, writing, and discovering your documentation

When you host your documentation on Mintlify, built-in AI features help your users find answers and your team maintain content more efficiently. Your content provides the context for these AI-native features to improve the experiences of reading, writing, and discovering your documentation.

## What makes your documentation AI-native

### Reading

In addition to reading individual pages, users can chat with the [assistant](/ai/assistant) in your documentation for immediate answers to their questions and links to relevant content. The assistant helps guide users through your product with accurate information from your documentation. Embed the assistant into custom apps with the [API](api-reference/assistant/create-assistant-message) to extend where users can access your documentation.

### Writing

The [agent](/ai/agent) helps you write and maintain documentation. It creates pull requests with proposed changes based on your prompts, pull requests, and Slack threads. Add the agent to your Slack workspace so that anyone on your team can help maintain your documentation by chatting with the agent. Or embed the agent into custom apps via the [API](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job).

Configure popular tools like [Cursor](/guides/cursor), [Claude Code](/guides/claude-code), and [Windsurf](/guides/windsurf) to reference the Mintlify schema, your style guide, and best practices.

### Discovering

Your site is automatically optimized for AI tools and search engines to help users discover your documentation. All pages are sent as Markdown to AI agents instead of HTML, which helps these tools process your content faster and use fewer tokens. Every page is also available to view as Markdown by appending `.md` to the URL.

Mintlify hosts `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` files for your documentation. These industry-standard files help LLMs index your documentation and respond efficiently with relevant information to user queries.

Your documentation site also hosts an MCP server that lets users connect your documentation directly to their AI tools for up to date information about your product directly where they want it.

Full-text search and semantic understanding help users and AI tools find relevant information quickly. Search understands user intent rather than just matching keywords. And if a user encounters a 404 error, your site suggests related pages to help them find what they're looking for. No configuration required.

# Agent
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/agent

Automate documentation updates with the agent. Create updates from Slack messages, PRs, or API calls.

<Info>
  The agent is available on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=agent) for anyone with access to your dashboard.
</Info>

The agent creates pull requests with proposed changes to your documentation based on your prompts. When you send a request to the agent, it references your documentation, connected repositories, and Slack messages to create content that follows technical writing best practices and adheres to the Mintlify schema. Access the agent directly in your dashboard, in your Slack workspace, or embed it in custom applications with the API.

Use the agent to:

* Write new content based on your prompts, links to pull requests, or Slack threads
* Revise outdated code examples and API references
* Search and update existing content
* Answer questions about your docs and technical writing topics

## Add the agent to your Slack workspace

You can also use the agent in Slack to collaborate with your team on documentation updates.

<Note>
  If your Slack Workspace Owner requires admin approval to install apps, ask them to approve the Mintlify app before you connect it.
</Note>

1. Open the agent panel in your dashboard.
2. Click the **Settings** button.

3. Select the **Connect** button in the Slack integration section.
4. Follow the Slack prompts to add the `mintlify` app to your workspace.
5. Follow the Slack prompts to link your Mintlify account to your Slack workspace.
6. Test that the agent is working and responds when you:
   * Send a direct message to it.
   * Mention it with `@mintlify` in a channel.

## Connect repositories as context

The agent can only access repositories that you connect through the Mintlify GitHub App. Configure which repositories the agent can access in the agent panel **Settings** or in the [GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Embed the agent via API

Use the agent endpoints to [create jobs](/api-reference/agent/create-agent-job), [get a specific job](/api-reference/agent/get-agent-job), and [get all jobs](/api-reference/agent/get-all-jobs).

When creating jobs via the API, you can control whether pull requests are created in draft mode using the `asDraft` parameter (defaults to `true`). Set `asDraft: false` to create non-draft pull requests ready for immediate review and merging in automated workflows.

## Write effective prompts

Think of the agent as a helpful assistant that needs your guidance to complete tasks. Give it clear instructions and context. More focused tasks are easier to complete, so break down complex projects into smaller steps.

Make your prompts specific and outcome-focused. Generic prompts like `@mintlify Improve the onboarding page` apply general best practices, but may not improve content in the specific way that you were picturing.

Try prompts based on outcomes you want your users to achieve or problems that they encounter. For example:

* `@mintlify A lot of users have trouble installing the CLI. Review the onboarding page and update the docs so that users can easily install the CLI`
* `@mintlify Developers keep getting 401 errors when following our authentication guide. Review the auth docs and add clearer examples showing how to properly format the API key`

Use broad prompts for general content maintenance like fixing typos, updating redirects, or renaming a feature throughout your docs. For example:

* `@mintlify Find and fix all typos in the docs`
* `@mintlify change all unordered lists to use * instead of -`

## Specify a domain name

If you have multiple documentation sites, include the `subdomain` parameter in your message to specify which documentation set the agent should work on.

To find your domain name, look at your dashboard URL for the documentation set you want to update. The domain name is the last part after your organization name. For example, if your dashboard URL is `https://dashboard.mintlify.com/org-name/domain-name`, your domain name is `domain-name`.

Use the format `@mintlify subdomain=<your-domain-name> <your-prompt>` to prompt the agent to work on a specific documentation set.

Examples:

* `@mintlify subdomain=public-docs Add a new section to the quickstart about inviting collaborators based on this PR`: Prompts the agent to update the quickstart only on the `public-docs` site.
* `@mintlify subdomain=customer-docs Update the auth docs for the new authentication method`: Prompts the agent to update the auth docs only on the `customer-docs` site.

## Agent workflows

The agent assists with many different documentation tasks. These workflows show some of the ways you can integrate the agent into your documentation process. Try an approach that fits how your team currently works and adapt it to your specific needs.

### Iterate on a prompt in a Slack thread

Prompt the agent, then continue to mention it with `@mintlify` in the same thread to refine and iterate on the pull request that it creates.

For example: `@mintlify Our quickstart page needs a new section on inviting collaborators`. Then `@mintlify The new section should be called "Inviting collaborators"`. Followed by any other iterations.

### Start with the agent, finish manually

Prompt the agent to begin a project, then check out the branch it creates and finish the task in your local environment or the web editor. The agent can help you get started, then you can take over to complete the task.

For example: `@mintlify Update the quickstart page to include information about inviting collaborators` and then checkout the branch to make any additional changes using your preferred method.

### Update docs when merging feature changes

When you merge a feature pull request, share the PR link with the agent to update relevant docs.

For example: `@mintlify This PR adds a new authentication method. Update the docs to include the new auth flow: [PR link]`.

### Generate release notes from a pull request

Prompt the agent with a specific pull request to generate release notes or changelog updates based on the commit history.

For example: `@mintlify Generate release notes for this PR: [PR link]`.

### Generate code examples

Prompt the agent to generate code examples for features throughout your docs or on specific pages.

For example: `@mintlify Generate a code example to make the authentication method easier to understand`.

### Review existing content

Prompt the agent to review existing content for technical accuracy, style, grammar, or other issues.

For example: `@mintlify Review the API rate limiting section. We changed limits last month`.

### Respond to user feedback

Prompt the agent with feedback from your users to make focused updates to your docs.

For example: `@mintlify Users are getting confused by step 3 in the setup guide. What might be making it unclear?`.

### Automate with the API

Integrate the agent into your existing automation tools to automatically update documentation when code changes occur, trigger content reviews, or sync documentation updates across multiple repositories.

Learn how in the [Auto-update documentation when code is merged](/guides/automate-agent) tutorial.


# Assistant
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/assistant

Add AI-powered chat to your docs that answers questions, cites sources, and generates code examples.

<Info>
  The assistant is automatically enabled on [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=assistant).
</Info>

## About the assistant

The assistant answers questions about your documentation through natural language queries. It is embedded directly in your documentation site, so users can find answers quickly and succeed with your product.

The assistant uses agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) with tool calling powered by Claude Opus 4.5. When users ask questions, the assistant:

* **Searches and retrieves** relevant content from your documentation to provide accurate answers.
* **Cites sources** and provides navigable links to take users directly to referenced pages.
* **Generates copyable code examples** to help users implement solutions from your documentation.

Each message sent to the assistant counts toward your plan's message allowance. If you exceed your allowance, additional messages incur overage charges. You can set spending limits or disable the assistant if you reach your message allowance.

You can view assistant usage through your dashboard to understand user behavior and documentation effectiveness. Export and analyze query data to help identify:

* Frequently asked questions that might need better coverage.
* Content gaps where users struggle to find answers.
* Popular topics that could benefit from additional content.

## Configure the assistant

The assistant is enabled by default for Pro and Custom plans.

Manage the assistant from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings). Click **Configuration** to enable or disable the assistant, configure response handling, add default questions, and set a spend limit.

### Set a spend limit

Set a spend limit to control what happens if you reach your message allowance. By default, the assistant continues to answer user questions after you reach your message allowance, which incurs overages.

When you reach your spend limit, the assistant is disabled until your message allowance resets.

1. Select the **Billing** tab.

## Use the assistant

Users have multiple ways to start a conversation with the assistant. Each method opens a chat panel on the right side of your docs. Users can ask any question and the assistant searches your documentation for an answer. If no relevant information is found, the assistant responds that it cannot answer the question.

### UI placement

Depending on how you configure your assistant placement, the assistant appears as either a button next to the search bar or a bar at the bottom of the page.

### URLs

Append `?assistant=open` to a URL to open the assistant when the page loads. For example, [https://mintlify.com/docs?assistant=open](https://mintlify.com/docs?assistant=open).

## Make content AI ingestible

Structure your documentation to help the assistant provide accurate, relevant answers. Clear organization and comprehensive context benefit both human readers and AI understanding.

<Card title="Structure and organization">
  * Use semantic markup.
  * Write descriptive headings for sections.
  * Create a logical information hierarchy.
  * Use consistent formatting across your docs.
  * Include comprehensive metadata in page frontmatter.
  * Break up long blocks of text into shorter paragraphs.
</Card>

<Card title="Context">
  * Define specific terms and acronyms when first introduced.
  * Provide sufficient conceptual content about features and procedures.
  * Include examples and use cases.
  * Cross-reference related topics.
  * Add [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages) with additional context that users don't need, but the assistant can reference.
</Card>

## Export and analyze queries

Review and export queries from your dashboard to understand how people interact with your documentation and identify improvement opportunities. Some ways that analyzing queries can help you improve your documentation:

* Identify content gaps where frequent queries receive insufficient answers.
* Discover user behavior patterns and common information needs from themes and patterns in queries.
* Prioritize high-traffic pages for accuracy and quality improvements.

You can explore queries from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant), but to get more powerful insights we recommend exporting a `CSV` file of your queries, responses, and sources to analyze with your preferred AI tool.

1. Navigate to the [assistant page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant) in your dashboard.
2. Click **Chat history**.
3. Click **Export to CSV**.
4. Analyze the exported data using your preferred tool.

<Card title="Sample analysis prompts">
  * Summarize the most common themes of the queries.
  * List any queries that had no sources cited.
  * Find patterns in unsuccessful interactions.
</Card>

## Assistant insights

Use assistant insights to understand how users interact with your documentation through two views: categories and chat history.

### Categories

The categories tab uses LLMs to automatically categorize conversations. Categories show a summary of the topic or theme, when a question was last asked about the category, and how many questions have been asked about the category over time.

Use categories to identify common topics, patterns in user needs and behavior, and areas where documentation might need expansion or clarification.

Click a category to view specific conversations about the category. You can then click individual conversations to view the complete chat thread, including the user's question, the assistant's response, and any sources cited.

### Chat history

The chat history tab displays chronological records of all assistant conversations. Click any message to view the complete chat thread, including the user's question, the assistant's response, and any sources cited.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Assistant chat bar not visible">
  If the assistant UI is not visible in specific browsers, you may need to submit a false positive report to [EasyList](https://easylist.to). Browsers that use the EasyList Cookies List like Brave and Comet sometimes block the assistant or other UI elements. The EasyList Cookies List includes a domain-specific rule that hides fixed elements on certain domains to block cookie banners. This rule inadvertently affects legitimate UI components.

  Submit a false positive report to [EasyList](https://github.com/easylist/easylist) to request removal of the rule. This resolves the issue for all users once the filter list is updated.

# Contextual menu
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/contextual-menu

Add one-click AI integrations to your docs.

export const PreviewButton = ({children, href}) => {
  return <a href={href} className="text-sm font-medium text-white dark:!text-zinc-950 bg-zinc-900 hover:bg-zinc-700 dark:bg-zinc-100 hover:dark:bg-zinc-300 rounded-full px-3.5 py-1.5 not-prose">
        {children}
      </a>;
};

The contextual menu provides quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools. When users select the contextual menu on any page, they can copy content as context for AI tools or open conversations in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or a custom tool of your choice with your documentation already loaded as context.

# llms.txt
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/llmstxt

Optimize your docs for LLMs to read and index.

export const PreviewButton = ({children, href}) => {
  return <a href={href} className="text-sm font-medium text-white dark:!text-zinc-950 bg-zinc-900 hover:bg-zinc-700 dark:bg-zinc-100 hover:dark:bg-zinc-300 rounded-full px-3.5 py-1.5 not-prose">
        {children}
      </a>;
};

The [llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps LLMs index content more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find content relevant to user queries.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms.txt` file at the root of your project that lists all available pages in your documentation. This file is always up to date and requires zero maintenance. You can optionally add a custom `llms.txt` file to the root of your project.

View your `llms.txt` by appending `/llms.txt` to your documentation site's URL.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open the llms.txt for this site.</PreviewButton>

## llms.txt structure

An `llms.txt` file is a plain Markdown file that contains:

* **Site title** as an H1 heading.
* **Structured content sections** with links and a description of each page in your documentation.

Pages are listed alphabetically in the order they appear in your repository, starting from the root directory.

Each page's description comes from the `description` field in its frontmatter. Pages without a `description` field appear in the `llms.txt` file without a description.

```mdx Example llms.txt theme={null}
# Site title

## Docs

- [API](https://example.com/docs/api): Endpoint list and usage
- [Install](https://example.com/docs/install): Setup steps
- [Getting started](https://example.com/docs/start): Intro guide
```

This structured approach allows LLMs to efficiently process your documentation at a high level and locate relevant content for user queries, improving the accuracy and speed of AI-assisted documentation searches.

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools and is indexed by LLM traffic.

Mintlify automatically hosts an `llms-full.txt` file at the root of your project. View your `llms-full.txt` by appending `/llms-full.txt` to your documentation site's URL.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open the llms-full.txt for this site.</PreviewButton>

## Custom files

To add a custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file, create an `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file of the same name. If you delete a custom file, the default file will be used again.

Your custom `llms.txt` or `llms-full.txt` file must have a site title as an H1 heading. Other content is optional. See [Format](https://llmstxt.org/#format) in the `llms.txt` specification for more information on optional sections and best practices.


# Markdown export
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/markdown-export

Quickly get Markdown versions of pages for AI tools and integrations.

export const PreviewButton = ({children, href}) => {
  return <a href={href} className="text-sm font-medium text-white dark:!text-zinc-950 bg-zinc-900 hover:bg-zinc-700 dark:bg-zinc-100 hover:dark:bg-zinc-300 rounded-full px-3.5 py-1.5 not-prose">
        {children}
      </a>;
};

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response accuracy, faster processing times, and lower token usage.

Mintlify automatically generates Markdown versions of pages that are optimized for AI tools and external integrations.

## .md URL extension

Add `.md` to any page's URL to view a Markdown version.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/markdown-export.md">Open this page as Markdown</PreviewButton>

## Keyboard shortcut

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) to copy a page as Markdown to your clipboard.


# Model Context Protocol
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/model-context-protocol

Connect your documentation and API endpoints to AI tools with a hosted MCP server.

export const PreviewButton = ({children, href}) => {
  return <a href={href} className="text-sm font-medium text-white dark:!text-zinc-950 bg-zinc-900 hover:bg-zinc-700 dark:bg-zinc-100 hover:dark:bg-zinc-300 rounded-full px-3.5 py-1.5 not-prose">
        {children}
      </a>;
};

## About MCP servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. Mintlify generates an MCP server from your documentation and OpenAPI specifications, preparing your content for the broader AI ecosystem where any MCP client (like Claude, Cursor, Goose, and others) can connect to your documentation and APIs.

Your MCP server exposes tools for AI applications to search your documentation and interact with your APIs.

### How MCP servers work

When an MCP server is connected to an AI tool, the LLM can decide to use your documentation and API tools during response generation.

* The LLM can proactively search your documentation or call your API endpoints while generating a response, not just when explicitly asked.
* The LLM determines when to use tools based on the context of the conversation and the relevance of your documentation and APIs.
* Each tool call happens during the generation process, allowing the LLM to incorporate real-time information from your documentation and APIs into its response.

For example, if a user asks a coding question and the LLM determines that your API documentation is relevant, it can search your API documentation and include that information in the response without the user explicitly asking about your documentation.

## Accessing your MCP server

<Note>
  MCP servers can only be generated for public documentation. Documentation behind end-user authentication cannot be accessed for server generation.
</Note>

Mintlify automatically generates an MCP server for your documentation and hosts it at your documentation URL with the `/mcp` path. For example, Mintlify's MCP server is available at `https://mintlify.com/docs/mcp`.

You can see and copy your MCP server URL in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp).

The `/mcp` path is reserved for hosted MCP servers and cannot be used for other navigation elements.

## Configuring your MCP server

All MCP servers include the `search` tool by default, which allows users to query information from your docs in other tools.

If you have a [Pro or Custom plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=mcp), you can expose endpoints from your OpenAPI specification as MCP tools.

To expose endpoints as MCP tools, use the `mcp` object within the `x-mint` extension at either the file or endpoint level. For example, the Mintlify MCP server includes tools to create assistant chats, get status updates, and trigger updates.

MCP servers follow a security-first approach where API endpoints are not exposed by default. You must explicitly enable endpoints to make them available as MCP tools. Only expose endpoints that are safe for public access through AI tools.

<ResponseField name="mcp" type="object">
  The MCP configuration for the endpoint.

  <Expandable title="MCP">
    <ResponseField name="enabled" type="boolean">
      Whether to expose the endpoint as an MCP tool. Takes precedence over the file-level configuration.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
      The name of the MCP tool.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
      The description of the MCP tool.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### File-level configuration

Enable MCP for all endpoints by default in an OpenAPI specification file and selectively exclude endpoints:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "x-mint": {
    "mcp": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  },
  // ...
  "paths": {
    "/api/v1/users": {
      "get": {
        "x-mint": {
          "mcp": {
            "enabled": false // Disables MCP for this endpoint
          }
        },
        // ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Endpoint-level configuration

Enable MCP for specific endpoints:

## Authentication

When you enable an API endpoint for MCP, the server includes the authentication requirements defined in your OpenAPI `securitySchemes` and `securityRequirement`. Any keys are handled directly by the tool and not stored or processed by Mintlify.

If a user asks their AI tool to call a protected endpoint, the tool will request the necessary authentication credentials from the user at that moment.

## Monitoring your MCP server

You can view all available MCP tools in the **Available tools** section of the [MCP Server page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp) in your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MCP server only shows search tool">
    If your MCP server only exposes the search tool despite having an OpenAPI specification:

    1. Verify your OpenAPI specification is valid and accessible.
    2. Ensure you've explicitly enabled MCP for specific endpoints using `x-mint.mcp.enabled: true`.
    3. Check your deployment logs for OpenAPI processing errors.

    If OpenAPI processing fails, the server continues with just the search tool to maintain functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Authentication issues">
    If users report authentication problems:

    1. Check that your OpenAPI specification includes proper `securitySchemes` definitions.
    2. Confirm that enabled endpoints work with the specified authentication methods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool descriptions missing or unclear">
    If AI tools aren't using your API endpoints effectively:

    1. Add detailed `summary` and `description` fields to your endpoints.
    2. Ensure parameter names and descriptions are self-explanatory.
    3. Use the MCP dashboard to verify how your endpoints appear as tools.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


# Add SDK examples
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/adding-sdk-examples

Display SDK code samples in your API documentation.

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can use the `x-codeSamples` extension to add code samples to your OpenAPI document and display them in your OpenAPI pages.

This property can be added to any request method and has the following schema.

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here is an example of code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml  theme={null}
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      # ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```


# AsyncAPI setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/asyncapi-setup

Create websocket documentation with AsyncAPI specifications.

## Demo

See the [websocket playground](/api-playground/websocket-playground) for an example of the AsyncAPI playground.

## Add an AsyncAPI specification file

To create pages for your websockets, you must have a valid AsyncAPI schema document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [AsyncAPI specification 3.0+](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0).

<Tip>
  Use the [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/) to validate your AsyncAPI schema.
</Tip>

```json {3} theme={null}
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- asyncapi.json
```

## Auto-populate websockets pages

To automatically generate pages for all channels in your AsyncAPI schema, add an `asyncapi` property to any navigation element. The `asyncapi` property accepts a path to an AsyncAPI schema document in your documentation repo, a URL to a hosted AsyncAPI document, or an array of links to AsyncAPI schema documents.

### Examples with tabs

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Local file theme={null}
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
          "tab": "API Reference",
          "asyncapi": "/path/to/asyncapi.json"
      }
    ]
  }

  ```

  ```json Remote URL theme={null}
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
          "tab": "API Reference",
          "asyncapi": "https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/examples/simple-asyncapi.yml"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Examples with groups

```json  theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "AsyncAPI",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Websockets",
          "asyncapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/asyncapi.json",
            "directory": "websockets"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The `directory` field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the **api-reference** folder of the docs repo.
</Note>

## Channel page

If you want more control over how you order your channels or if you want to reference only specific channels, create an MDX file with the `asyncapi` property in the frontmatter.

```mdx  theme={null}
---
title: "Websocket Channel"
asyncapi: "/path/to/asyncapi.json channelName"
---
```


# Complex data types
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/complex-data-types

Describe APIs with flexible schemas, optional properties, and multiple data formats using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords.

When your API accepts multiple data formats, has conditional fields, or uses inheritance patterns, OpenAPI's schema composition keywords help you document these flexible structures. Using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf`, you can describe APIs that handle different input types or combine multiple schemas into comprehensive data models.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf` keywords

For complex data types, OpenAPI provides keywords for combining schemas:

* `allOf`: Combines multiple schemas (like merging objects or extending a base schema). Functions like an `and` operator.
* `anyOf`: Accepts data matching any of the provided schemas. Functions like an `or` operator.
* `oneOf`: Accepts data matching exactly one of the provided schemas. Functions like an `exclusive-or` operator.

<Warning>Mintlify treats `oneOf` and `anyOf` identically since the practical difference rarely affects using the API.</Warning>

For detailed specifications of these keywords see the [OpenAPI documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/).

<Info>The `not` keyword is currently unsupported.</Info>

### Combining schemas with `allOf`

When you use `allOf`, Mintlify performs some preprocessing on your OpenAPI document to display complex combinations in a readable way. For example, when you combine two object schemas with `allOf`, Mintlify combines the properties of both into a single object. This becomes especially useful when leveraging OpenAPI's reusable [components](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/).

```yaml  theme={null}
org_with_users:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Org'
    - type: object
      properties:
        users:
          type: array
          description: An array containing all users in the organization
# ...
components:
  schemas:
    Org:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: The ID of the organization
```

<ParamField body="org_with_users" type="object">
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The ID of the organization
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="users" type="object[]">
      An array containing all users in the organization
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Providing options with `oneOf` and `anyOf`

When you use `oneOf` or `anyOf`, the options are displayed in a tabbed container. Specify a `title` field in each subschema to give your options names. For example, here's how you might display two different types of delivery addresses:

```yaml  theme={null}
delivery_address:
  oneOf:
    - title: StreetAddress
      type: object
      properties:
        address_line_1:
          type: string
          description: The street address of the recipient
        # ...
    - title: POBox

# Manage page visibility
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/managing-page-visibility

Control which API endpoints appear in your documentation navigation.

For internal-only endpoints, deprecated operations, beta features, or endpoints that should be accessible via direct URL but not discoverable through site navigation, you can control which OpenAPI operations get published as documentation pages and their visibility in navigation.

If your pages are autogenerated from an OpenAPI document, manage page visibility with the `x-hidden` and `x-excluded` extensions.

## `x-hidden`

The `x-hidden` extension creates a page for an endpoint, but hides it from navigation. The page is only accessible by navigating directly to its URL.

Common use cases for `x-hidden` are:

* Endpoints you want to document, but not promote.
* Pages that you will link to from other content.
* Endpoints for specific users.

## `x-excluded`

The `x-excluded` extension completely excludes an endpoint from your documentation.

Common use cases for `x-excluded` are:

* Internal-only endpoints.
* Deprecated endpoints that you don't want to document.
* Beta features that are not ready for public documentation.

## Implementation

Add the `x-hidden` or `x-excluded` extension under the HTTP method in your OpenAPI specification.

Here are examples of how to use each property in an OpenAPI schema document for an endpoint and a webhook path.

```json Endpoint example {11, 19} theme={null}
"paths": {
  "/plants": {
    "get": {
      "description": "Returns all plants from the store",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Returns all somewhat secret plants from the store",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Returns all top secret plants from the store (do not publish this endpoint!)",
      "parameters": { /*...*/ },
      "responses": { /*...*/ }
    }
  }
},
```

```json Webhook example {9, 15} theme={null}
"webhooks": {
  "/plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "description": "Webhook for information about a new plant added to the store",
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Webhook for somewhat secret information about a new plant added to the store"
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Webhook for top secret information about a new plant added to the store (do not publish this endpoint!)"
    }
  }
}
```


# Create manual API pages
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx-setup

Document API endpoints manually with MDX files.

You can manually define API endpoints in individual MDX pages. This approach is useful for small APIs or prototyping.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API settings">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and authentication method.

    ```json  theme={null}
    "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api",
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you want to hide the API playground, set the `display` field to `none`. You don't need to include an authentication method if you hide the playground.

    ```json  theme={null}
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations in [Settings](/organize/settings#api-configurations).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">
    Create an MDX file for each endpoint. Define the `title` and `api` in the frontmatter:

    ```mdx  theme={null}
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    Specify path parameters by wrapping them in `{}`:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Tip>
      If you have a `server` field configured in `docs.json`, you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.
    </Tip>

    To override the global playground display mode for a specific page, add `playground` to the frontmatter:

    ```mdx  theme={null}
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ---
    ```

    Options:

    * `playground: 'interactive'` - Display the interactive playground (default)
    * `playground: 'simple'` - Display a copyable endpoint with no playground
    * `playground: 'none'` - Hide the playground entirely
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add parameters and responses">
    Use [parameter and response fields](/components/fields) to document your endpoint's parameters and return values.

    ```mdx  theme={null}
    <ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
      Unique identifier for the user
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="email" type="string" required>
      User's email address
    </ParamField>

    <ResponseField name="id" type="string" required>
      Unique identifier for the newly created user
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="email" type="string" required>
      User's email address
    </ResponseField>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the navigation by updating the `pages` field in your `docs.json`:

    ```json docs.json theme={null}
    "navigation": {
      "tabs": [
        {
          "tab": "API Reference",
          "groups": [
            {
              "group": "Users",
              "pages": [
                "api-reference/users/create-user",
                "api-reference/users/get-user",
                "api-reference/users/update-user"
              ]
            },
            {
              "group": "Orders",
              "pages": [
                "api-reference/orders/create-order",
                "api-reference/orders/list-orders"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Each page path corresponds to an MDX file in your docs repository. For example, `api-reference/users/create-user.mdx`. Learn more about structuring your docs in [Navigation](/organize/navigation).

    ### Using OpenAPI endpoints in navigation

    If you have an OpenAPI specification, you can reference endpoints directly in your navigation without creating individual MDX files. Reference specific endpoints by including the OpenAPI file path and the endpoint:

    ```json docs.json theme={null}
    "navigation": {
      "pages": [
        "introduction",
        "/path/to/users-openapi.json POST /users",
        "/path/to/orders-openapi.json GET /orders"
      ]
    }
    ```

    You can also set a default OpenAPI spec for a navigation group and reference endpoints by method and path:

    ```json docs.json theme={null}
    {
      "group": "API reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
      "pages": [
        "overview",
        "authentication",
        "GET /users",
        "POST /users",
        {
          "group": "Orders",
          "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
          "pages": [
            "GET /orders",
            "POST /orders"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    For more details on OpenAPI integration, see [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enable authentication

You can set authentication globally in `docs.json` or override it on individual pages using the `authMethod` field in frontmatter. A page-specific method overrides the global setting.

### Bearer token

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json theme={null}
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "bearer"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```mdx Page Metadata theme={null}
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "bearer"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Basic authentication

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json theme={null}
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "basic"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```mdx Page Metadata theme={null}
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "basic"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### API key

<CodeGroup>
  ```json docs.json theme={null}
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "x-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```mdx Page Metadata theme={null}
  ---
  title: "Your page title"
  authMethod: "key"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### None

To disable authentication on a specific page, set `authMethod` to `none`:

```mdx Page Metadata theme={null}
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "none"
---
```


# Multiple responses
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/multiple-responses

Document multiple response variations for API endpoints.

If your API returns different responses based on input parameters, user context, or other conditions of the request, you can document multiple response examples with the `examples` property.

This property can be added to any response and has the following schema.

```yaml  theme={null}
responses:
  "200":
    description: Successful response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/YourResponseSchema"
        examples:
          us:
            summary: Response for United States
            value:
              countryCode: "US"
              currencyCode: "USD"
              taxRate: 0.0825
          gb:
            summary: Response for United Kingdom
            value:
              countryCode: "GB"
              currencyCode: "GBP"
              taxRate: 0.20
```


# OpenAPI setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi-setup

Generate API pages from your OpenAPI specification automatically.

OpenAPI is a specification for describing APIs. Mintlify supports OpenAPI 3.0+ documents to generate interactive API documentation and keep it up to date.

## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To document your endpoints with OpenAPI, you need a valid OpenAPI specification in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification 3.0+](https://swagger.io/specification/).

You can reference multiple OpenAPI specifications to create pages for your API. Either organize sections for each specification in your navigation or reference specific endpoints from different specifications.

<Note>
  Mintlify supports `$ref` for **internal references only** within a single OpenAPI document. External references are not supported.
</Note>

### Describe your API

We recommend the following resources to learn about and construct your OpenAPI specification.

* [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/) to learn the OpenAPI syntax.
* [The OpenAPI specification Markdown sources](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/) to reference details of the latest OpenAPI specification.
* [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to edit, validate, and debug your OpenAPI document.
* [The Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to validate your OpenAPI document with the command: `mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`.

<Note>
  Swagger's OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, see [Migrating from OpenAPI 3.0 to 3.1.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0) in the OpenAPI blog.
</Note>

### Specify the base URL for your API

To enable the API playground, add a `servers` field to your OpenAPI specification with your API's base URL.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

In an OpenAPI specification, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}` or simply `/`. The base URL defines where these paths should be appended. For more information on how to configure the `servers` field, see [API Server and Base Path](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/) in the OpenAPI documentation.

The API playground uses these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If you specify multiple servers, a dropdown allows users to toggle between servers. If you do not specify a server, the API playground uses simple mode since it cannot send requests without a base URL.

If your API has endpoints that exist at different URLs, you can [override the `servers` field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/api-host-and-base-path/#overriding-servers) for a given path or operation.

### Specify authentication

To enable authentication in your API documentation and playground, configure the `securitySchemes` and `security` fields in your OpenAPI specification. The API descriptions and API playground add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI specification.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your authentication method.">
    Add a `securitySchemes` field to define how users authenticate.

    This example shows a configuration for bearer authentication.

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "components": {
        "securitySchemes": {
          "bearerAuth": {
            "type": "http",
            "scheme": "bearer"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply authentication to your endpoints.">
    Add a `security` field to require authentication.

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "security": [
        {
          "bearerAuth": []
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Common authentication types include:

* [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/): For header, query, or cookie-based keys.
* [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/): For JWT or OAuth tokens.
* [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/): For username and password.

If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override the `security` field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation.

For more information on defining and applying authentication, see [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) in the OpenAPI documentation.

## Customize your endpoint pages

Customize your endpoint pages by adding the `x-mint` extension to your OpenAPI specification. The `x-mint` extension provides additional control over how your API documentation is generated and displayed.

### Metadata

Override the default metadata for generated API pages by adding `x-mint: metadata` to any operation. You can use any metadata field that would be valid in MDX frontmatter except for `openapi`.

```json {7-13} theme={null}
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Get users",
        "description": "Retrieve a list of users",
        "x-mint": {
          "metadata": {
            "title": "List all users",
            "description": "Fetch paginated user data with filtering options",
            "og:title": "Display a list of users"
          }
        },
        "parameters": [
          {
            // Parameter configuration
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Content

Add content before the auto-generated API documentation using `x-mint: content`. The `x-mint: content` extension supports all Mintlify MDX components and formatting.

```json {6-8} theme={null}
{
  "paths": {
    "/users": {
      "post": {
        "summary": "Create user",
        "x-mint": {
          "content": "## Prerequisites\n\nThis endpoint requires admin privileges and has rate limiting.\n\n<Note>User emails must be unique across the system.</Note>"
        },
        "parameters": [
          {
            // Parameter configuration
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Href

Change the URL of the endpoint page in your docs using `x-mint: href`. When `x-mint: href` is present, the navigation entry links directly to the specified URL instead of generating an API page.

```json {6-8, 14-16} theme={null}
{
  "paths": {
    "/legacy-endpoint": {
      "get": {
        "summary": "Legacy endpoint",
        "x-mint": {
          "href": "/deprecated-endpoints/legacy-endpoint"
        }
      }
    },
    "/documented-elsewhere": {
      "post": {
        "summary": "Special endpoint",
        "x-mint": {
          "href": "/guides/special-endpoint-guide"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### MCP

Selectively expose endpoints as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools by using `x-mint: mcp`. Only enable endpoints that are safe for public access through AI tools.

<ResponseField name="mcp" type="object">
  The MCP configuration for the endpoint.

  <Expandable title="MCP">
    <ResponseField name="enabled" type="boolean">
      Whether to expose the endpoint as an MCP tool. Takes precedence over the file-level configuration.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="name" type="string">
      The name of the MCP tool.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="description" type="string">
      The description of the MCP tool.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Selective enablement {6-9} wrap theme={null}
  {
    "paths": {
      "/users": {
        "post": {
          "summary": "Create user",
          "x-mint": {
            "mcp": {
              "enabled": true
            },
            // ...
          }
        }
      },
      "/users": {
        "delete": {
          "summary": "Delete user (admin only)",
          // No `x-mint: mcp` so this endpoint is not exposed as an MCP tool
          // ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```json Global enablement {3-5, 9-13} wrap theme={null}
  {
    "openapi": "3.1.0",
    "x-mcp": {
        "enabled": true // All endpoints are exposed as MCP tools by default
      },
    "paths": {
      "/api/admin/delete": {
        "delete": {
          "x-mint": {
            "mcp": {
              "enabled": false // Disable MCP for this endpoint
            }
          },
          "summary": "Delete resources"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

For more information, see [Model Context Protocol](/ai/model-context-protocol).

## Auto-populate API pages

Add an `openapi` field to any navigation element in your `docs.json` to automatically generate pages for OpenAPI endpoints. You can control where these pages appear in your navigation structure, as dedicated API sections or with other pages.

The `openapi` field accepts either a file path in your docs repo or a URL to a hosted OpenAPI document.

Generated endpoint pages have these default metadata values:

* `title`: The operation's `summary` field, if present. If there is no `summary`, the title is generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.
* `description`: The operation's `description` field, if present.
* `version`: The `version` value from the parent anchor or tab, if present.
* `deprecated`: The operation's `deprecated` field. If `true`, a deprecated label appears next to the endpoint title in the side navigation and on the endpoint page.

<Tip>
  To exclude specific endpoints from your auto-generated API pages, add the [x-hidden](/api-playground/managing-page-visibility#x-hidden) property to the operation in your OpenAPI spec.
</Tip>

There are two approaches for adding endpoint pages into your documentation:

1. **Dedicated API sections**: Reference OpenAPI specs in navigation elements for dedicated API sections.
2. **Selective endpoints**: Reference specific endpoints in your navigation alongside other pages.

### Dedicated API sections

Generate dedicated API sections by adding an `openapi` field to a navigation element and no other pages. All endpoints in the specification are included.

```json {5} theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

To organize multiple OpenAPI specifications in separate sections of your documentation, assign each specification to a different group in your navigation hierarchy. Each group can reference its own OpenAPI specification.

```json {8-11, 15-18} theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Users API",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/users-openapi.json",
            "directory": "users-api-reference"
          }
        },
        {
          "group": "Admin API",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/admin-openapi.json",
            "directory": "admin-api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The `directory` field is optional and specifies where generated API pages are stored in your docs repo. If not specified, defaults to the `api-reference` directory of your repo.
</Note>

### Selective endpoints

When you want more control over where endpoints appear in your documentation, you can reference specific endpoints in your navigation. This approach allows you to generate pages for API endpoints alongside other content. You can also use this approach to mix endpoints from different OpenAPI specifications.

#### Set a default OpenAPI spec

Configure a default OpenAPI specification for a navigation element. Then reference specific endpoints in the `pages` field.

```json {12, 15-16} theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Getting started",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "installation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "API reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "pages": [
        "api-overview",
        "GET /users",
        "POST /users",
        "guides/authentication"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Any page entry matching the format `METHOD /path` generates an API page for that endpoint using the default OpenAPI specification.

#### OpenAPI spec inheritance

OpenAPI specifications are inherited down the navigation hierarchy. Child navigation elements inherit their parent's OpenAPI specification unless they define their own.

```json {3, 7-8, 11, 13-14} theme={null}
{
  "group": "API reference",
  "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
  "pages": [
    "overview",
    "authentication",
    "GET /users",
    "POST /users",
    {
      "group": "Orders",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
      "pages": [
        "GET /orders",
        "POST /orders"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Individual endpoints

Reference specific endpoints without setting a default OpenAPI specification by including the file path. You can reference endpoints from multiple OpenAPI specifications in the same documentation section.

```json {5-6} theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "pages": [
    "introduction",
    "user-guides",
    "/path/to/users-openapi.json POST /users",
    "/path/to/orders-openapi.json GET /orders"
  ]
}
```

This approach is useful when you need individual endpoints from different specifications, only want to include select endpoints, or want to include endpoints alongside other types of documentation.

## Create MDX pages from your OpenAPI specification

For more granular control over individual endpoint pages, create MDX pages from your OpenAPI specification. This lets you customize page metadata, content, and reorder or exclude pages in your navigation while still using the auto-generated parameters and responses.

There are two ways to document your OpenAPI specification with individual MDX pages:

* Document endpoints with the `openapi` field in the frontmatter.
* Document data models with the `openapi-schema` field in the frontmatter.

### Document endpoints

Create a page for each endpoint and specify which OpenAPI operation to display using the `openapi` field in the frontmatter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```mdx Example theme={null}
  ---
  title: "Get users"
  description: "Returns all plants from the system that the user has access to"
  openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
  deprecated: true
  version: "1.0"
  ---
  ```

  ```mdx Format theme={null}
  ---
  title: "title of the page"
  description: "description of the page"
  openapi: openapi-file-path method path
  deprecated: boolean (not required)
  version: "version-string" (not required)
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The method and path must exactly match your OpenAPI spec. If you have multiple OpenAPI specifications, include the file path in your reference. External OpenAPI URLs can be referenced in `docs.json`.

#### Autogenerate endpoint pages

To autogenerate MDX files from your OpenAPI specification, use the Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping).

```bash  theme={null}
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o <folder-name>
```

<Tip>
  Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.
</Tip>

### Document data models

Create a page for each data structure defined in your OpenAPI specification's `components.schemas` using the `openapi-schema` field in the frontmatter.

<CodeGroup>
  ```mdx Example theme={null}
  ---
  openapi-schema: OrderItem
  ---
  ```

  ```mdx Format theme={null}
  ---
  openapi-schema: "openapi-file-path schema-key"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

If you have schemas with the same name in multiple files, specify the OpenAPI file:

<CodeGroup>
  ```mdx Example theme={null}
  ---
  openapi-schema: en-schema.json OrderItem
  ---
  ```

  ```mdx Format theme={null}
  ---
  openapi-schema: "path-to-schema-file schema-key"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Webhooks

Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that your API sends to notify external systems when events occur. Webhooks are supported in OpenAPI 3.1+ documents.

Add a `webhooks` field to your OpenAPI document alongside the `paths` field.

For more information on defining webhooks, see [Webhooks](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0#oasWebhooks) in the OpenAPI documentation.

To create an MDX page for a webhook (OpenAPI 3.1+), use `webhook` instead of an HTTP method:

```mdx  theme={null}
---
title: "Order updated webhook"
description: "Triggered when an order is updated"
openapi: "openapi.json webhook orderUpdated"
---
```

The webhook name must exactly match the key in your OpenAPI spec's `webhooks` field.


# Playground

Let developers test API endpoints directly in your documentation.

## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation.

See [Trigger an update](/api/update/trigger) for an example of the API playground in action.

</Frame>

The playground generates interactive pages for your endpoints based on your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema. If you modify your API, the playground automatically updates the relevant pages.

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. However, you can manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenAPI specification file.">
    <Tip>
      Validate your OpenAPI specification file using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) command `mint openapi-check <filename>`.
    </Tip>

    ```bash {3} theme={null}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate endpoint pages.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification.

    **To automatically generate pages for all endpoints in your OpenAPI specification**, add an `openapi` property to any navigation element.

    This example generates a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organizes the pages in the "API reference" group.

    ```json Generate all endpoint pages theme={null}
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "API reference",
          "openapi": "openapi.json"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    **To generate pages for only specific endpoints**, list the endpoints in the `pages` property of the navigation element.

    This example generates pages for only the `GET /users` and `POST /users` endpoints. To generate other endpoint pages, add additional endpoints to the `pages` array.

    ```json Generate specific endpoint pages theme={null}
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /users",
              "POST /users"
            ]
          }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customize your playground

Customize your API playground by defining the following properties in your `docs.json`.

<ResponseField name="playground" type="object">
  Configurations for the API playground.

  <Expandable title="playground" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="display" type="&#x22;interactive&#x22; | &#x22;simple&#x22; | &#x22;none&#x22;">
      The display mode of the API playground.

      * `"interactive"`: Display the interactive playground.
      * `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
      * `"none"`: Display nothing.

      Defaults to `interactive`.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="proxy" type="boolean" defaultOpen="True">
      Whether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="examples" type="object">
  Configurations for the autogenerated API examples.

  <Expandable title="examples" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="languages" type="array of string">
      Example languages for the autogenerated API snippets.

      Languages display in the order specified.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="defaults" type="&#x22;required&#x22; | &#x22;all&#x22;">
      Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="prefill" type="boolean">
      Whether to prefill the API playground with data from schema examples. When enabled, the playground automatically populates request fields with example values from your OpenAPI specification. Defaults to `false`.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example configuration

This example configures the API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in the code snippets, and the playground prefills the request body with example values.

```json  theme={null}
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required",
     "prefill": true
   }
 }
}
```

### Custom endpoint pages

When you need more control over your API documentation, use the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification or create individual MDX pages for your endpoints.

Both options allow you to:

* Customize page metadata
* Add additional content like examples
* Control playground behavior per page

The `x-mint` extension is recommended so that all of your API documentation is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification and maintained in one file.

Individual MDX pages are recommended for small APIs or when you want to experiment with changes on a per-page basis.

# Troubleshooting
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/troubleshooting

Resolve common issues with API page configuration.

If your API pages aren't displaying correctly, check these common configuration issues.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mint dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, there's a great chance the problem is elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3):

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
    the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

    Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

    ```mdx get-user.mdx theme={null}
    ---
    openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
    ---
    ```

    ```yaml openapi.yaml theme={null}
    paths:
      "/users/{id}":
        get: ...
    ```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

    ```mdx api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx theme={null}
    ---
    openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
    `/_mintlify/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/_mintlify/api/request` path.

    Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described in the [settings documentation](/organize/settings#param-proxy). When using this configuration, you will need to configure CORS on your server since requests will come directly from users' browsers rather than through your proxy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI navigation entries are not generating pages">
    If you are using an OpenAPI navigation configuration, but the pages aren't generating, check these common issues:

    1. **Missing default OpenAPI spec**: Ensure you have an `openapi` field set for the navigation element:

    ```json {5} theme={null}
    "navigation": {
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "API reference",
          "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
          "pages": [
            "GET /users",
            "POST /users"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    2. **OpenAPI spec inheritance**: If using nested navigation, ensure child groups inherit the correct OpenAPI spec or specify their own.

    3. **Validation issues**: Use `mint openapi-check <path-to-openapi-file>` to verify your OpenAPI document is valid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Some OpenAPI operations appear in navigation but others don't">
    1. **Hidden operations**: Operations marked with `x-hidden: true` in your OpenAPI spec won't appear in auto-generated navigation.
    2. **Invalid operations**: Operations with validation errors in the OpenAPI spec may be skipped. Check your OpenAPI document for syntax errors.
    3. **Manual vs automatic inclusion**: If you reference any endpoints from an OpenAPI spec, only the explicitly referenced operations will appear in navigation. No other pages will be automatically added. This includes operations that are referenced in child navigation elements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mixed navigation (OpenAPI and MDX pages) not working correctly">
    When combining OpenAPI operations with regular documentation pages in navigation:

    1. **File conflicts**: You cannot have both an `MDX` file and a navigation entry for the same operation. For example, if you have `get-users.mdx`, do not also include `"GET /users"` in your navigation.  If you need to have a file that shares a name with an operation, use the `x-mint` extension for the endpoint to have the href point to a different location.
    2. **Path resolution**: Navigation entries that don't match OpenAPI operations will be treated as file paths. Ensure your `MDX` files exist at the expected locations.
    3. **Case sensitivity**: OpenAPI operation matching is case-sensitive. Ensure HTTP methods are uppercase in navigation entries.
  </Accordion>

Add a banner to display important site-wide announcements and notifications.

Use banners to display important announcements, updates, or notifications across your entire documentation site. Banners appear at the top of every page, support Markdown formatting, and can be made dismissible. Banners use the color defined by the `colors.dark` property in your `docs.json`.

To add a banner, use the `banner` property in your `docs.json`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Product announcements wrap theme={null}
  "banner": {
    "content": "🚀 Version 2.0 is now live! See our [changelog](/changelog) for details.",
    "dismissible": true
  }
  ```

  ```json Maintenance notices wrap theme={null}
  "banner": {
    "content": "⚠️ Scheduled maintenance: API will be unavailable December 15, 2-4 AM UTC",
    "dismissible": false
  }
  ```

  ```json Required actions wrap theme={null}
  "banner": {
    "content": "**Action required:** Migrate to our new version by January 1. [Migration guide](/migration)",
    "dismissible": true
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Properties

<ResponseField name="content" type="string" required>
  The banner message. Supports plain text and Markdown formatting.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="dismissible" type="boolean">
  Whether users can dismiss the banner. When `true`, users can close the banner and it won't reappear for their session. Defaults to `false`.
</ResponseField>


# Callouts
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/callouts

Use callouts to style and emphasize important content.

Callouts can be styled as a Note, Warning, Info, Tip, Check, Danger, or create your own callout:

<Note>This adds a note in the content</Note>

```mdx  theme={null}
<Note>This adds a note in the content</Note>
```

<Warning>This raises a warning to watch out for</Warning>

```mdx  theme={null}
<Warning>This raises a warning to watch out for</Warning>
```

<Info>This draws attention to important information</Info>

```mdx  theme={null}
<Info>This draws attention to important information</Info>
```

<Tip>This suggests a helpful tip</Tip>

```mdx  theme={null}
<Tip>This suggests a helpful tip</Tip>
```

<Check>This brings us a checked status</Check>

```mdx  theme={null}
<Check>This brings us a checked status</Check>
```

<Danger>This is a danger callout</Danger>

# Cards
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/cards

Highlight main points or links with customizable layouts and icons.

Use cards to create visual containers for content. Cards are flexible containers that can include text, icons, images, and links.

## Basic card

<Card title="Card title" icon="text-align-start" href="/components/columns">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>

```mdx Card example theme={null}
<Card title="Card title" icon="text-align-start" href="/components/columns">
  This is how you use a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card
  brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>
```

## Card variations

Cards support several layout and styling options to fit different content needs.

### Horizontal layout

Add the `horizontal` property to display cards in a more compact, horizontal layout.

<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="text-align-start" horizontal>
  This is an example of a horizontal card.
</Card>

```mdx Horizontal card example theme={null}
<Card title="Horizontal card" icon="text-align-start" horizontal>
  This is an example of a horizontal card.
</Card>
```

### Image cards

Add an `img` property to display an image at the top of the card.

<Card title="Image card" img="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/yosemite.jpg">
  This is an example of a card with an image.
</Card>

```mdx Image card example theme={null}
<Card title="Image card" img="/images/card-with-image.png">
  This is an example of a card with an image.
</Card>
```

### Link cards with custom CTAs

You can customize the call-to-action text and control whether an arrow appears. By default, arrows only show for external links.

<Card title="Link card" icon="link" href="/components/columns" arrow="true" cta="Click here">
  This is an example of a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>

```mdx Link card example theme={null}
<Card
  title="Link card"
  icon="link"
  href="/components/columns"
  arrow="true"
  cta="Click here"
>
  This is an example of a card with an icon and a link. Clicking on this card brings you to the Columns page.
</Card>
```

## Grouping cards

Use the [Columns component](/components/columns) to organize multiple cards side by side.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="First card" icon="panel-left-close">
    This is the first card.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Second card" icon="panel-right-close">
    This is the second card.
  </Card>
</Columns>

```mdx Columns example theme={null}

# Code groups
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/code-groups

Display multiple code examples in one component

Use the `CodeGroup` component to display multiple code blocks in a tabbed interface, allowing users to compare implementations across different programming languages or see alternative approaches for the same task.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript helloWorld.js theme={null}
  console.log("Hello World");
  ```

  ```python hello_world.py theme={null}
  print('Hello World!')
  ```

  ```java HelloWorld.java theme={null}
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Code groups inherit global styling from your `docs.json` file. Customize your theme using `styling.codeblocks`. See [Settings](/organize/settings#styling) for configuration options.

## Creating code groups

To create a code group, wrap multiple code blocks with `<CodeGroup>` tags. Each code block must include a title, which becomes the tab label.

````mdx  theme={null}
<CodeGroup>

```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>
````

## Language dropdown

You can replace the tabs in a code group with a dropdown menu to toggle between languages using the `dropdown` prop.

<CodeGroup dropdown>
  ```javascript helloWorld.js theme={null}
  console.log("Hello World");
  ```

  ```python hello_world.py theme={null}
  print('Hello World!')
  ```

  ```java HelloWorld.java theme={null}
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

````mdx highlight=1 theme={null}
<CodeGroup dropdown>

```javascript helloWorld.js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```python hello_world.py
print('Hello World!')
```

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
````


# Color
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/color

Display color palettes with click-to-copy functionality.

Use the Color component to showcase color palettes in your documentation. Colors can be displayed in a compact grid or organized in a table with labeled rows.

# Columns
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/columns

Show elements side by side

The `Columns` component lets you group multiple `Card` components together. It's most often used to put cards in a grid, by specifying the number of grid columns.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get started" icon="rocket">
    Set up your project with our quickstart guide.
  </Card>

  <Card title="API reference" icon="code">
    Explore endpoints, parameters, and examples for your API.
  </Card>
</Columns>

```mdx Columns example theme={null}
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get started">
    Set up your project with our quickstart guide.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API reference">
    Explore endpoints, parameters, and examples for your API.
  </Card>
</Columns>
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="cols" default={2}>
  The number of columns per row.
</ResponseField>


# Examples
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/examples

Display code blocks in the right sidebar on desktop devices

The `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` components display code blocks in the right sidebar to create a two-column layout that keeps examples visible while users scroll through your content. These components are designed for API documentation, but they work on all pages.

Common use cases:

* API endpoint documentation with request and response examples
* Configuration examples alongside explanatory text
* Code samples that users reference while following instructions
* Before and after examples in tutorials

On mobile devices, `<RequestExample>` and `<ResponseExample>` components display as regular code blocks and can be scrolled past.

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request theme={null}
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
  ```
</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>
  ```json Response theme={null}
  { "status": "success" }
  ```
</ResponseExample>

## RequestExample

Use `<RequestExample>` to pins code examples in the right sidebar. This component works similarly to the [CodeGroup](/components/code-groups) component, but displays the code in the sidebar instead of inline.

You can include multiple code blocks inside a single `<RequestExample>`. Each code block must have a title attribute.

````mdx RequestExample theme={null}
<RequestExample>

```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://dog-api.kinduff.com/api/facts
```

</RequestExample>
````

## ResponseExample

The `<ResponseExample>` component pins code examples in the right sidebar beneath any `<RequestExample>` content on the same page.

````mdx ResponseExample theme={null}
<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{ "status": "success" }
```

</ResponseExample>
````


# Expandables
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/expandables

Toggle to display nested properties

Use expandables to show and hide nested content within response fields. Expandables are particularly useful for displaying complex object properties in API documentation.

<ResponseField name="user" type="User Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="full_name" type="string">
      The full name of the user
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="is_over_21" type="boolean">
      Whether the user is over 21 years old
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

```mdx Expandable example theme={null}
<ResponseField name="user" type="User Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="full_name" type="string">
      The full name of the user
    </ResponseField>

    <ResponseField name="is_over_21" type="boolean">
      Whether the user is over 21 years old
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="title" type="string">
  The name of the object you are showing.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="defaultOpen" type="boolean" default="false">
  Set to `true` for the expandable to open when the page loads
</ResponseField>


# Fields
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/components/fields

Document API request and response parameters with type information.

Use fields to document API parameters and responses. There are two types of fields: parameter fields and response fields.

## Parameter field

The `<ParamField>` component is used to define parameters for your APIs or SDKs. Adding a `ParamField` automatically adds an [API Playground](/api-playground/overview).

<ParamField path="param" type="string" required>
  An example of a parameter field
</ParamField>

```mdx  theme={null}
<ParamField path="param" type="string" required>
  An example of a parameter field
</ParamField>
```

### Properties

<ParamField body="query, path, body, or header" type="string">
  Whether the parameter is a query, path, body, or header. Followed by the
  parameter name.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
  Expected type of the parameter's value.

  Supports `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`.

  Arrays can be defined using the `[]` suffix. For example `string[]`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="required" type="boolean">
  Indicate whether the parameter is required.

# Changelogs
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/changelogs

Create product changelogs with RSS feed support for subscribers.

Create a changelog for your docs by adding [Update components](/components/update) to a page.

Check out the [Mintlify changelog](/changelog) as an example: you can include links, images, text, and demos of your new features in each update.

## Setting up your changelog

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a page for your changelog">
    1. Create a new page in your docs such as `changelog.mdx` or `updates.mdx`.
    2. Add your changelog page to your navigation scheme in your `docs.json`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Update components to your changelog">
    Add an `Update` for each changelog entry.

    Include relevant information like feature releases, bug fixes, or other announcements.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```mdx Example changelog.mdx theme={null}
---
title: "Changelog"
description: "Product updates and announcements"
---
<Update label="March 2025" description="v0.0.10">
  Added a new Wintergreen flavor.

  Released a new version of the Spearmint flavor, now with 10% more mint.
</Update>

<Update label="February 2025" description="v0.0.09">

</Update>
```

## Customizing your changelog

Control how people navigate your changelog and stay up to date with your product information.

### Table of contents

Each `label` property for an `Update` automatically creates an entry in the right sidebar's table of contents. This is the default navigation for your changelog.

<Tip>
  The table of contents and changelog filters are hidden when using `custom`, `center`, or `wide` page modes. Learn more about [page modes](/organize/pages#page-mode).
</Tip>

### Subscribable changelogs

Using `Update` components creates a subscribable RSS feed at your page URL with `/rss.xml` appended. For example, `mintlify.com/docs/changelog/rss.xml`.

Entries are added to the RSS feed when new `Update` components are published and when new headings are added inside of existing `<Update>` tags.

The top level headings of `Update` components are used as the titles of RSS feed entries, and the entries link to their heading anchors in your docs.

```xml Example RSS feed theme={null}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" version="2.0">

```

RSS feeds can integrate with Slack, email, or other subscription tools to notify users of product changes. Some options include:

* [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/218688467-Add-RSS-feeds-to-Slack)
* [Email](https://zapier.com/apps/email/integrations/rss/1441/send-new-rss-feed-entries-via-email) via Zapier
* Discord bots like [Readybot](https://readybot.io) or [RSS Feeds to Discord Bot](https://rss.app/en/bots/rssfeeds-discord-bot)

To make the RSS feed discoverable, you can display an RSS icon button that links to the feed at the top of the page. Add `rss: true` to the page frontmatter:

```mdx  theme={null}
---
rss: true
---
```

# Format code
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/code

Display and style inline code and code blocks.

## Adding code samples

You can add inline code snippets or code blocks. Code blocks support meta options for syntax highlighting, titles, line highlighting, icons, and more.

### Inline code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (\`).

```mdx  theme={null}
To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
```

### Code blocks

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks. Code blocks are copyable, and if you have the assistant enabled, users can ask AI to explain the code.

Specify the programming language for syntax highlighting and to enable meta options. Add any meta options, like a title or icon, after the language.

<CodeGroup>
  ```java HelloWorld.java example icon=java lines theme={null}
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```java HelloWorld.java example lines icon="java"
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

## Code block options

Add meta options to your code blocks to customize their appearance.

<Note>
  You must specify a programming language for a code block before adding any other meta options.
</Note>

### Option syntax

* **String and boolean options**: Wrap with `""`, `''`, or no quotes.
* **Expression options**: Wrap with `{}`, `""`, or `''`.

### Syntax highlighting

Enable syntax highlighting by specifying the programming language after the opening backticks of a code block.

We use [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) for syntax highlighting and support all available languages. See the full list of [languages](https://shiki.style/languages) in Shiki's documentation.

Customize code block themes globally using `styling.codeblocks` in your `docs.json` file. Set simple themes like `system` or `dark`, or configure custom [Shiki themes](https://shiki.style/themes) for light and dark modes. See [Settings](/organize/settings#param-styling) for configuration options.

<Accordion title="Custom syntax highlighting theme">
  For custom themes, set your theme in `docs.json` to `"css-variables"` and override syntax highlighting colors using CSS variables with the `--mint-` prefix.

  The following variables are available:

  **Basic colors**

  * `--mint-color-text`: Default text color
  * `--mint-color-background`: Background color

  **Token colors**

  * `--mint-token-constant`: Constants and literals
  * `--mint-token-string`: String values
  * `--mint-token-comment`: Comments
  * `--mint-token-keyword`: Keywords
  * `--mint-token-parameter`: Function parameters
  * `--mint-token-function`: Function names
  * `--mint-token-string-expression`: String expressions
  * `--mint-token-punctuation`: Punctuation marks
  * `--mint-token-link`: Links

  **ANSI colors**

  * `--mint-ansi-black`, `--mint-ansi-black-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-red`, `--mint-ansi-red-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-green`, `--mint-ansi-green-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-yellow`, `--mint-ansi-yellow-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-blue`, `--mint-ansi-blue-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-magenta`, `--mint-ansi-magenta-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-cyan`, `--mint-ansi-cyan-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-white`, `--mint-ansi-white-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-black`, `--mint-ansi-bright-black-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-red`, `--mint-ansi-bright-red-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-green`, `--mint-ansi-bright-green-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-yellow`, `--mint-ansi-bright-yellow-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-blue`, `--mint-ansi-bright-blue-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-magenta`, `--mint-ansi-bright-magenta-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-cyan`, `--mint-ansi-bright-cyan-dim`
  * `--mint-ansi-bright-white`, `--mint-ansi-bright-white-dim`
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>
  ```java Syntax highlighting example theme={null}
  class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}

      }
  }
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Twoslash

In JavaScript and TypeScript code blocks, use `twoslash` to enable interactive type information. Users can hover over variables, functions, and parameters to see types and errors like in an IDE.

<CodeGroup>
  ```ts twoslash Twoslash example theme={null}
  type Pet = "cat" | "dog" | "hamster";

  function adoptPet(name: string, type: Pet) {
  return `${name} the ${type} is now adopted!`;
  }

  // Hover to see the inferred types
  const message = adoptPet("Mintie", "cat");
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```ts twoslash Twoslash example
  type Pet = "cat" | "dog" | "hamster";

  function adoptPet(name: string, type: Pet) {
    return `${name} the ${type} is now adopted!`;
  }

  // Hover to see the inferred types
  const message = adoptPet("Mintie", "cat");
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Title

Add a title to label your code example. Use `title="Your title"` or a string on a single line.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Title example theme={null}
  const hello = "world";
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Title example
  const hello = "world";
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Icon

Add an icon to your code block using the `icon` property. See [Icons](/components/icons) for all available options.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Icon example icon=square-js theme={null}
  const hello = "world";
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Icon example icon="square-js"
  const hello = "world";
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Line highlighting

Highlight specific lines in your code blocks using `highlight` with the line numbers or ranges you want to highlight.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Line highlighting example {1,2,5} theme={null}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Line highlighting example highlight={1-2,5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Line focusing

Focus on specific lines in your code blocks using `focus` with line numbers or ranges.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Line focusing example focus=2,4,5 theme={null}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Line focusing example focus={2,4-5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Show line numbers

Display line numbers on the left side of your code block using `lines`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Show line numbers example lines theme={null}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Show line numbers example lines
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Expandable

Allow users to expand and collapse long code blocks using `expandable`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```python Expandable example expandable theme={null}

  from typing import Dict, List, Optional
  from dataclasses import dataclass

              raise ValueError("Book is already checked out")

          if len(self.checkouts[patron]) >= 3:
              raise ValueError("Patron has reached checkout limit")

          book.checked_out = True
          book.due_date = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=days)
          self.checkouts[patron].append(isbn)

      def return_book(self, isbn: str) -> float:
          book = self.books.get(isbn)
          if not book or not book.checked_out:
              raise ValueError("Book not found or not checked out")

          late_fee = 0.0
          if datetime.now() > book.due_date:
              days_late = (datetime.now() - book.due_date).days
              late_fee = days_late * 0.50

          book.checked_out = False
          book.due_date = None

          # Remove from patron's checkouts
          for patron, books in self.checkouts.items():
              if isbn in books:
                  books.remove(isbn)
                  break

          return late_fee

      def search(self, query: str) -> List[Book]:
          query = query.lower()
          return [
              book for book in self.books.values()
              if query in book.title.lower() or query in book.author.lower()
          ]

  def main():
  library = Library()

      # Add some books
      books = [
          Book("The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", "978-0-261-10295-4"),
          Book("1984", "George Orwell", "978-0-452-28423-4"),

      late_fee = library.return_book("978-0-261-10295-4")
      print(f"Late fee: ${late_fee:.2f}")

  if **name** == "**main**":

  from typing import Dict, List, Optional
  from dataclasses import dataclass

  # ...

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Wrap

Enable text wrapping for long lines using `wrap`. This prevents horizontal scrolling and makes long lines easier to read.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Wrap example wrap theme={null}
  const greeting = "Hello, World! I am a long line of text that will wrap to the next line.";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````mdx Format theme={null}
  ```javascript Wrap example wrap
  const greeting = "Hello, World! I am a long line of text that will wrap to the next line.";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````
</CodeGroup>

### Diff

Show a visual diff of added or removed lines in your code blocks. Added lines are highlighted in green and removed lines are highlighted in red.

To create diffs, add these special comments at the end of lines in your code block:

* `// [!code ++]`: Mark a line as added (green highlight).
* `// [!code --]`: Mark a line as removed (red highlight).

For multiple consecutive lines, specify the number of lines after a colon:

* `// [!code ++:3]`: Mark the current line plus the next two lines as added.
* `// [!code --:5]`: Mark the current line plus the next four lines as removed.

The comment syntax must match your programming language (for example, `//` for JavaScript or `#` for Python).

<CodeGroup>

# Files
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/files

Serve static assets from your documentation.

Mintlify automatically serves static assets from your documentation repository at the appropriate path on your domain. For example, if you have `/images/my-logo.png` in your repo, the image file is available at `https://docs.your-project.com/images/my-logo.png`.

You can make any supported file type available to your users, including OpenAPI specifications, images, videos, and more.

Files must be less than 20 MB for images and 100 MB for other file types.

<Note>
  File serving is not supported for documentation sites with authentication enabled. If your site requires authentication, static files will not be accessible at their direct URLs.

## File organization

Organize your files using folders to keep your repository easy to navigate:

```text  theme={null}
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- images/
    |- logo.png
    |- screenshots/
      |- dashboard.png
  |- assets/
    |- whitepaper.pdf
    |- demo-video.mp4
```

Files are served from the root of your domain, so the structure in your repository directly maps to the URL structure. From the previous example, `assets/whitepaper.pdf` would be available at `https://docs.your-project.com/assets/whitepaper.pdf`.


# Images and embeds
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/image-embeds

Add images, videos, andiframes.

Add images, embed videos, and include interactive content with iframes to your documentation.

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-xl" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/bigbend.jpg" alt="Photograph of a scenic landscape with purple flowers in the foreground, mountains in the background, and a blue sky with scattered clouds." />
</Frame>

## Images

Add images to provide visual context, examples, or decoration to your documentation.

### Basic image syntax

Use [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) to add images to your documentation:

```mdx  theme={null}
![Alt text describing the image](/path/to/image.png)
```

<Tip>
  Always include descriptive alt text to improve accessibility and SEO. The alt text should clearly describe what the image shows.
</Tip>

Image files must be less than 20 MB. For larger files, host them on a CDN service like [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) or [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).

### HTML image embeds

For more control over image display, use HTML `<img>` tags:

```jsx  theme={null}
<img
  src="/images/dashboard.png"
  alt="Main dashboard interface"
  style={{height: "300px", width: "400px"}}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
```

#### Resize images with inline styles

Use JSX inline styles with the `style` attribute to resize images:

```jsx  theme={null}
<img
  src="/images/architecture.png"
  style={{width: "450px", height: "auto"}}
  alt="Diagram showing the architecture of the system"
/>
```

#### Disable zoom functionality

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the `noZoom` property:

```html highlight="4" theme={null}
<img
  src="/images/screenshot.png"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  noZoom
/>
```

#### Link images

To make an image a clickable link, wrap the image in an anchor tag and add the `noZoom` property:

```html  theme={null}
<a href="https://mintlify.com" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/images/logo.png"
    alt="Mintlify logo"
    noZoom
  />
</a>
```

<Note>
  Images within anchor tags automatically display a pointer cursor to indicate they are clickable.
</Note>

#### Light and dark mode images

To display different images for light and dark themes, use Tailwind CSS classes:

```html  theme={null}
<!-- Light mode image -->
<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/light-mode.png"
  alt="Light mode interface"
/>

<!-- Dark mode image -->
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/dark-mode.png"
  alt="Dark mode interface"
/>
```

## Videos

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html), giving you flexibility to create rich content.

<Tip>
  Always include fallback text content within video elements for browsers that don't support video playback.
</Tip>

### YouTube embeds

Embed YouTube videos using iframe elements:

```html  theme={null}
<iframe
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>
```

<Frame>
  <iframe className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowFullScreen />
</Frame>

### Self-hosted videos

Use the HTML `<video>` element for self-hosted video content:

```html  theme={null}
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

### Autoplay videos

To autoplay a video, use:

```html  theme={null}
<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
  src="/videos/demo.mp4"
></video>
```

<Note>
  When using JSX syntax, write double-word attributes in camelCase: `autoPlay`, `playsInline`, `allowFullScreen`.
</Note>

## iframes

Embed external content using iframe elements:

```html  theme={null}
<iframe
  src="https://example.com/embed"
  title="Embedded content"
  className="w-full h-96 rounded-xl"
></iframe>
```

# Lists and tables
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/list-table

Format structured data with tables and lists.

## Lists

Lists follow the official [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).

### Ordered list

To create an ordered list, add numbers followed by a period before list items.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```mdx  theme={null}
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered list

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) before list items.

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

```mdx  theme={null}
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested list

Indent list items to nest them.

* First item
* Second item
  * Additional item
  * Additional item
* Third item

```mdx  theme={null}
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

## Tables

Tables follow the official [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |

```mdx  theme={null}
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |
```


# Redirects
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/redirects

Configure redirects for moved, renamed, or deleted pages.

When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it also changes the URL path to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field to your `docs.json` file.

```json  theme={null}
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This permanently redirects `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` matches `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json  theme={null}
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```

## Broken links

Catch broken links with our CLI. [Install the CLI](/installation) and run the command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint broken-links
```

The CLI identifies any relative links in your docs that don't exist.


# Reusable snippets
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/reusable-snippets

Create reusable snippets to maintain consistency across pages.

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself), which applies to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should create a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a custom snippet

**Pre-condition**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory in order for the import to work.

Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
be rendered into a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a
component.

### Default export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx theme={null}
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages.
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```typescript destination-file.mdx theme={null}
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet/>

```

### Exporting with variables

1. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is word.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx theme={null}
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file with the variable. The property will fill in based on your specification.

```typescript destination-file.mdx theme={null}
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />

```

### Reusable variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```typescript snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx theme={null}
export const myName = "my name";

export const myObject = { fruit: "strawberries" };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```typescript destination-file.mdx theme={null}
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### JSX snippets

1. Export a JSX component from your snippet file. (See [React components](/customize/react-components) for more information):

```js icon=square-js snippets/my-jsx-snippet.jsx theme={null}
export const MyJSXSnippet = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

<Note>
  Important: When creating JSX snippets, use arrow function syntax (`=>`) rather
  than function declarations. The `function` keyword is not supported in this
  context.
</Note>

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the component:

```typescript destination-file.mdx theme={null}
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyJSXSnippet } from '/snippets/my-jsx-snippet.jsx';

<MyJSXSnippet />
```


# Format text
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/create/text

Learn how to format text, create headers, and style content.

## Headers

Headers organize your content and create navigation anchors. They appear in the table of contents and help users scan your documentation.

### Creating headers

Use `#` symbols to create headers of different levels:

```mdx  theme={null}
## Main section header
### Subsection header
#### Sub-subsection header
```

<Tip>
  Use descriptive, keyword-rich headers that clearly indicate the content that follows. This improves both user navigation and search engine optimization.
</Tip>

### Disabling anchor links

By default, headers include clickable anchor links that allow users to link directly to specific sections. You can disable these anchor links using the `noAnchor` prop in HTML or React headers.

<CodeGroup>
  ```mdx HTML header example theme={null}
  <h2 noAnchor>
  Header without anchor link
  </h2>
  ```

  ```mdx React header example theme={null}
  <Heading level={2} noAnchor>
  Header without anchor link
  </Heading>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

When `noAnchor` is used, the header will not display the anchor chip and clicking the header text will not copy the anchor link to the clipboard.

## Text formatting

We support most Markdown formatting for emphasizing and styling text.

### Basic formatting

Apply these formatting styles to your text:

| Style             | Syntax     | Example                | Result                 |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Bold**          | `**text**` | `**important note**`   | **important note**     |
| *Italic*          | `_text_`   | `_emphasis_`           | *emphasis*             |
| ~~Strikethrough~~ | `~text~`   | `~deprecated feature~` | ~~deprecated feature~~ |

### Combining formats

You can combine formatting styles:

```mdx  theme={null}
**_bold and italic_**
**~~bold and strikethrough~~**
*~~italic and strikethrough~~*
```

***bold and italic***<br />
**~~bold and strikethrough~~**<br />
*~~italic and strikethrough~~*

### Superscript and subscript

For mathematical expressions or footnotes, use HTML tags:

| Type        | Syntax            | Example               | Result              |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>text</sup>` | `example<sup>2</sup>` | example<sup>2</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>text</sub>` | `example<sub>n</sub>` | example<sub>n</sub> |

## Links

Links help users navigate between pages and access external resources. Use descriptive link text to improve accessibility and user experience.

### Internal links

Link to other pages in your documentation using root-relative paths:

```mdx  theme={null}
[Quickstart](/quickstart)
[Steps](/components/steps)
```

[Quickstart](/quickstart)<br />
[Steps](/components/steps)

### External links

For external resources, include the full URL:

```mdx  theme={null}
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
```

[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

### Broken links

You can check for broken links in your documentation using the [CLI](/installation):

```bash  theme={null}
mint broken-links
```

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes highlight important information, quotes, or examples within your content.

### Single line blockquotes

Add `>` before text to create a blockquote:

```mdx  theme={null}
> This is a quote that stands out from the main content.
```

> This is a quote that stands out from the main content.

### Multi-line blockquotes

For longer quotes or multiple paragraphs:

```mdx  theme={null}
> This is the first paragraph of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph, separated by an empty line with `>`.
```

> This is the first paragraph of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph, separated by an empty line with `>`.

<Tip>
  Use blockquotes sparingly to maintain their visual impact and meaning. Consider using [callouts](/components/callouts) for notes, warnings, and other information.
</Tip>

## Mathematical expressions

We support LaTeX for rendering mathematical expressions and equations. You can override automated detection by configuring `styles.latex` in your `docs.json` [settings](/organize/settings#param-latex).

### Inline math

Use single dollar signs, `$`, for inline mathematical expressions:

```mdx  theme={null}
The Pythagorean theorem states that $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$ in a right triangle.
```

The Pythagorean theorem states that $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$ in a right triangle.

### Block equations

Use double dollar signs, `$$`, for standalone equations:

```mdx  theme={null}
$$
E = mc^2
$$
```

$$
E = mc^2
$$

<Info>
  LaTeX support requires proper mathematical syntax. Refer to the [LaTeX documentation](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/) for comprehensive syntax guidelines.
</Info>

## Line breaks and spacing

Control spacing and line breaks to improve content readability.

### Paragraph breaks

Separate paragraphs with blank lines:

```mdx  theme={null}
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph, separated by a blank line.
```

This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph, separated by a blank line.

### Manual line breaks

Use HTML `<br />` tags for forced line breaks within paragraphs:

```mdx  theme={null}
This line ends here.<br />
This line starts on a new line.
```

This line ends here.<br />
This line starts on a new line.

<Tip>
  In most cases, paragraph breaks with blank lines provide better readability than manual line breaks.
</Tip>

## Best practices

### Content organization

* Use headers to create clear content hierarchy
* Follow proper header hierarchy (don't skip from H2 to H4)
* Write descriptive, keyword-rich header text

### Text formatting

* Use bold for emphasis, not for entire paragraphs
* Reserve italics for terms, titles, or subtle emphasis
* Avoid over-formatting that distracts from content

### Links

* Write descriptive link text instead of "click here" or "read more"
* Use root-relative paths for internal links
* Test links regularly to prevent broken references

## Configure your DNS

1. On your domain provider's website, navigate to your domain's DNS settings.
2. Create a new DNS record with the following values:

```text  theme={null}
CNAME | docs | cname.mintlify-dns.com.
```

<Tip>
  Each domain provider has different ways to add DNS records. Refer to your domain provider's documentation for specific instructions.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img alt="Sample CNAME settings for a custom domain hosted on Vercel." src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

### DNS propagation

DNS changes typically take 1-24 hours to propagate globally, though it can take up to 48 hours in some cases. You can verify your DNS is configured correctly using [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org).

Once your DNS records are active, your documentation is first accessible via HTTP. HTTPS is available after Vercel provisions your TLS certificate.

### Automatic TLS provisioning

Once your DNS records propagate and resolve correctly, Vercel automatically provisions a free SSL/TLS certificate for your domain using Let's Encrypt.

This typically completes within a few hours of DNS propagation, though it can take up to 24 hours in rare cases. Certificates are automatically renewed before expiration.

### CAA records

If your domain uses CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) records, you must authorize Let's Encrypt to issue certificates for your domain. Add the following CAA record to your DNS settings:

```text  theme={null}
0 issue "letsencrypt.org"
```

### Reserved paths

The `/.well-known/acme-challenge` path is reserved for certificate validation and cannot be redirected or rewritten. If you have configured redirects or rewrites for this path, certificate provisioning will fail.

### Provider-specific settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Vercel verification">
    If Vercel is your domain provider, you must add a verification `TXT` record. This information appears on your dashboard after submitting your custom domain, and is emailed to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cloudflare encryption mode">
    If Cloudflare is your DNS provider, you must enable the "Full (strict)" mode for the SSL/TLS encryption setting. Additionally, disable "Always Use HTTPS" in your Edge Certificates settings. Cloudflare's HTTPS redirect will block Let's Encrypt from validating your domain during certificate provisioning.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Set a canonical URL

After configuring your DNS, set a canonical URL to ensure search engines index your preferred domain. A canonical URL tells search engines which version of your documentation is the primary one. This improves SEO when your documentation is accessible from multiple URLs and prevents issues with duplicate content.

Add the `canonical` meta tag to your `docs.json`:

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com"
    }
}
```

Replace `https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com` with your actual custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is `docs.mintlify.com`, you would use:

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://docs.mintlify.com"
    }
}
```


# Custom scripts
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/customize/custom-scripts

Add custom JavaScript and CSS to fully customize the look and feel of your documentation.

Use CSS to style HTML elements or add custom CSS and JavaScript to fully customize the look and feel of your documentation.

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Use Tailwind CSS v3 to style HTML elements. You can control layout, spacing, colors, and other visual properties. Some common classes are:

* `w-full` - Full width
* `aspect-video` - 16:9 aspect ratio
* `rounded-xl` - Large rounded corners
* `block`, `hidden` - Display control
* `dark:hidden`, `dark:block` - Dark mode visibility

Tailwind CSS arbitrary values are not supported. For custom values, use the `style` prop instead.

```html  theme={null}
<img style={{ width: '350px', margin: '12px auto' }} src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Custom CSS

Add CSS files to your repository and their defined class names will be applied and available in all of your MDX files.

### Adding `style.css`

For example, you can add the following `style.css` file to customize the styling of the navbar and footer.

```css  theme={null}
#navbar {
  background: #fffff2;
  padding: 1rem;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

### Using identifiers and selectors

Mintlify has a set of common identifiers and selectors to help you tag important elements of the UI.

<Tip>
  Use inspect element to find references to elements you're looking to customize.
</Tip>

## Custom JavaScript

Custom JS allows you to add custom executable code globally. It is the equivalent of adding a `<script>` tag with JS code into every page.

### Adding custom JavaScript

Any `.js` file inside the content directory of your docs will be included in every documentation page. For example, you can add the following `ga.js` file to enable [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics) across the entire documentation.

```js  theme={null}
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```

# Fonts
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/customize/fonts

Customize typography with Google Fonts or self-hosted fonts.

Set a custom font for your entire site or separately for headings and body text. Use Google Fonts, local font files, or externally hosted fonts. The default font varies by theme.

Fonts are controlled by the [fonts property](/organize/settings#param-fonts) in your `docs.json`.

## Google Fonts

Mintlify automatically loads [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) when you specify a font family name in your `docs.json`.

```json docs.json theme={null}
"fonts": {
  "family": "Inter"
}
```

## Local fonts

To use local fonts, place your font files in your project directory and reference them in your `docs.json` configuration.

### Setting up local fonts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add font files to your project">
    For example, create a `fonts` directory and add your font files:

    ```text  theme={null}
    your-project/
    ├── fonts/
    │   ├── InterDisplay-Regular.woff2
    │   └── InterDisplay-Bold.woff2
    ├── docs.json
    └── ...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure fonts in docs.json">
    Reference your local fonts using relative paths from your project root:

    ```json docs.json theme={null}
    {
      "fonts": {
        "family": "InterDisplay",
        "source": "/fonts/InterDisplay-Regular.woff2",
        "format": "woff2",
        "weight": 400
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Local fonts for headings and body

Configure separate local fonts for headings and body text in your `docs.json`:

```json docs.json theme={null}
{
  "fonts": {
    "heading": {
      "family": "InterDisplay",
      "source": "/fonts/InterDisplay-Bold.woff2",
      "format": "woff2",
      "weight": 700
    },
    "body": {
      "family": "InterDisplay",
      "source": "/fonts/InterDisplay-Regular.woff2",
      "format": "woff2",
      "weight": 400
    }
  }
}
```

## Externally hosted fonts

Use externally hosted fonts by referencing a font source URL in your `docs.json`:

```json docs.json theme={null}
{
  "fonts": {
    "family": "Hubot Sans",
    "source": "https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/fonts/Hubot-Sans.woff2",
    "format": "woff2",
    "weight": 400
  }
}
```

You can build React components directly in your MDX files using [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

### Example

This example declares a `Counter` component and then uses it with `<Counter />`.

```mdx  theme={null}
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1)
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1)

  return (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="flex items-center rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20">
        <button
          onClick={decrement}
          className="flex items-center justify-center h-8 w-8 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 border-r border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20"
          aria-label="Decrease"
        >
          -
        </button>

        <div className="flex text-sm items-center justify-center h-8 px-6 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 font-medium min-w-[4rem] text-center">
          {count}
        </div>

        <button
          onClick={increment}
          className="flex items-center justify-center h-8 w-8 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 border-l border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20"
          aria-label="Increase"
        >
          +
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

<Counter />
```

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
  return <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="flex items-center rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20">
        <button onClick={decrement} className="flex items-center justify-center h-8 w-8 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 border-r border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20" aria-label="Decrease">
          -
        </button>

        <div className="flex text-sm items-center justify-center h-8 px-6 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 font-medium min-w-[4rem] text-center">
          {count}
        </div>

        <button onClick={increment} className="flex items-center justify-center h-8 w-8 text-zinc-950/80 dark:text-white/80 border-l border-zinc-950/20 dark:border-white/20" aria-label="Increase">
          +
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>;
};


The counter renders as an interactive React component.

<Counter />

## Importing components

To import React components in your MDX files, the component files must be located in the `snippets` folder. You can then import them into any MDX page in your documentation. Learn more about [reusable snippets](/create/reusable-snippets).

### Example

This example declares a `ColorGenerator` component that uses multiple React hooks and then uses it in an MDX file.

Create `color-generator.jsx` file in the `snippets` folder:

```mdx /snippets/color-generator.jsx [expandable] theme={null}
export const ColorGenerator = () => {
  const [hue, setHue] = useState(180)
  const [saturation, setSaturation] = useState(50)
  const [lightness, setLightness] = useState(50)
  const [colors, setColors] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const newColors = []
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      const l = Math.max(10, Math.min(90, lightness - 20 + i * 10))
      newColors.push(`hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, ${l}%)`)
    }
    setColors(newColors)
  }, [hue, saturation, lightness])

  const copyToClipboard = (color) => {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(color)
      .then(() => {
        console.log(`Copied ${color} to clipboard!`)
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error("Failed to copy: ", err)
      })
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-4 border dark:border-zinc-950/80 rounded-xl not-prose">
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
            Hue: {hue}°
            <input
              type="range"
              min="0"
              max="360"
              value={hue}
              onChange={(e) => setHue(Number.parseInt(e.target.value))}
              className="w-full h-2 bg-zinc-950/20 rounded-lg appearance-none cursor-pointer dark:bg-white/20 mt-1"
              style={{

                  hsl(120, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(180, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(240, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(300, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(360, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>

          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
            Saturation: {saturation}%
            <input
              type="range"
              min="0"
              max="100"
              value={saturation}
              onChange={(e) => setSaturation(Number.parseInt(e.target.value))}
              className="w-full h-2 bg-zinc-950/20 rounded-lg appearance-none cursor-pointer dark:bg-white/20 mt-1"
              style={{
                background: `linear-gradient(to right,
                  hsl(${hue}, 0%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(${hue}, 50%, ${lightness}%),
                  hsl(${hue}, 100%, ${lightness}%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>

          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
            Lightness: {lightness}%
            <input
              type="range"
              min="0"
              max="100"
              value={lightness}
              onChange={(e) => setLightness(Number.parseInt(e.target.value))}
              className="w-full h-2 bg-zinc-950/20 rounded-lg appearance-none cursor-pointer dark:bg-white/20 mt-1"
              style={{
                background: `linear-gradient(to right,
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 0%),
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 50%),
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 100%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>
        </div>

        <div className="flex space-x-1">
          {colors.map((color, idx) => (
            <div
              key={idx}
              className="h-16 rounded flex-1 cursor-pointer transition-transform hover:scale-105"
              style={{ backgroundColor: color }}
              title={`Click to copy: ${color}`}
              onClick={() => copyToClipboard(color)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>

        <div className="text-sm font-mono text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
          <p>
            Base color: hsl({hue}, {saturation}%, {lightness}%)
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Import the `ColorGenerator` component and use it in an MDX file:

```mdx  theme={null}
import { ColorGenerator } from "/snippets/color-generator.jsx"

<ColorGenerator />
```

The color generator renders as an interactive React component.

<ColorGenerator />

## Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client-side rendering impact">
    React hook components render on the client-side, which has several implications:

    * **SEO**: Search engines might not fully index dynamic content.
    * **Initial load**: Visitors may experience a flash of loading content before components render.
    * **Accessibility**: Ensure dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance best practices">
    * **Optimize dependency arrays**: Include only necessary dependencies in your `useEffect` dependency arrays.
    * **Memoize complex calculations**: Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` for expensive operations.
    * **Reduce re-renders**: Break large components into smaller ones to prevent cascading re-renders.
    * **Lazy loading**: Consider lazy loading complex components to improve initial page load time.

# Editor permissions
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/dashboard/permissions

Allow more members of your team to update your documentation.

An editor has access to your dashboard and web editor.

Anyone can contribute to your documentation by working locally and pushing changes to your repository, but there are key differences in how changes get deployed:

* **Editor changes**: When an editor publishes through the web editor or merges a pull request into your docs repository, changes deploy to your live site automatically.
* **Non-editor changes**: When a non-editor merges a pull request into your repository, you must manually trigger a deployment from your dashboard for those changes to appear on your live site.

## Add editors

By default, the team member who created your Mintlify organization has editor access. Add additional editors in the [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members) page of your dashboard.

Editor seats are billed based on usage, and you can have as many editors as you need. See our [pricing page](https://mintlify.com/pricing) for more details.


# Roles
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/dashboard/roles

Assign Owner, Admin, or Editor roles to manage team access and permissions.

<Info>
  RBAC functionality is available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=rbac).
</Info>

Mintlify provides two dashboard access levels: Editor and Admin.

The following describes actions that are limited to the Admin role:

|                         | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :---: |
| Update user roles       |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Delete users            |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Invite admin users      |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Update Git source       |    ❌   |   ✅   |
| Delete org              |    ❌   |   ✅   |

Other actions on the dashboard are available to both roles.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.


# Single sign-on (SSO)
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/dashboard/sso

Set up SAML or OIDC with identity providers for team authentication.

<Info>
  SSO functionality is available on [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=sso).
</Info>

Use single sign-on to your dashboard via SAML and OIDC. If you use Okta, Google Workspace, or Microsoft Entra, we have provider-specific documentation for setting up SSO. If you use another provider, please [contact us](mailto:support@mintlify.com).

# Authentication setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/authentication-setup

Control access to your documentation by authenticating users.

<Info>
  [Pro plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include password authentication.

  [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication) include all authentication methods.
</Info>

Authentication requires users to log in before accessing your documentation.

## Authentication modes

Choose between full and partial authentication modes based on your access control needs.

**Full authentication**: All pages are protected. Users must log in before accessing any content.

**Partial authentication**: Some pages are publicly viewable while others require authentication. Users can browse public content freely and authenticate only when accessing protected pages.

When configuring any handshake method below, you'll select either **Full authentication** or **Partial authentication** in your dashboard settings.

## Configure authentication

Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Password">
    <Info>
      Password authentication provides access control only and does **not** support content personalization.
    </Info>

    ### Prerequisites

    * Your security requirements allow sharing passwords among users.

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create a password.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
        3. Select **Password**.
        4. Enter a secure password.
        5. Select **Save changes**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Distribute access.">
        Securely share the password and documentation URL with authorized users.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` and you need basic access control without tracking individual users. You want to prevent public access while keeping setup simple.

    **Create a strong password** in your dashboard. **Share credentials** with authorized users. That's it!
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mintlify dashboard">
    ### Prerequisites

    * Everyone who needs to access your documentation must be a member of your Mintlify organization.

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Enable Mintlify dashboard authentication.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
        3. Select **Mintlify Auth**.
        4. Select **Enable Mintlify Auth**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Add authorized users.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Members](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
        2. Add each person who should have access to your documentation.
        3. Assign appropriate roles based on their editing permissions.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` and your entire team has access to your dashboard. You want to restrict access to team members only.

    **Enable Mintlify authentication** in your dashboard settings.

    **Verify team access** by checking that all team members are added to your organization.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    ### Prerequisites

    * An OAuth or OIDC server that supports the Authorization Code Flow.
    * Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens (optional, to enable personalization features).

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure your OAuth settings.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
        3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:

        * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth endpoint.
        * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
        * **Client Secret**: Your OAuth 2.0 client secret.
        * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Copy the **entire** scope string (for example, for a scope like `provider.users.docs`, copy the complete `provider.users.docs`). Use multiple scopes if you need different access levels.
        * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
        * **Info API URL** (optional): Endpoint on your server that Mintlify calls to retrieve user info for personalization. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity and the user info will be empty.
        * **Logout URL**: The native logout URL for your OAuth provider. If your provider has a `returnTo` or similar parameter, point it back to your docs URL.

        4. Select **Save changes**.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
        1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Add the redirect URL as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create your user info endpoint (optional).">
        To enable personalization features, create an API endpoint that:

        * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
        * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [User data format](/deploy/personalization-setup#user-data-format) for more information.

        Add this endpoint URL to the **Info API URL** field in your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server at `auth.foo.com` that supports the Authorization Code Flow.

    **Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:

    * **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
    * **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
    * **Scopes**: `['provider.users.docs']`
    * **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
    * **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`
    * **Logout URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/logout?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%2Fdocs`

    **Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `provider.users.docs` scope, and returns:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "content": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      },
      "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
    }
    ```

    **Configure your OAuth server to allow redirects** to your callback URL.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JWT">
    ### Prerequisites

    * An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
    * A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate a private key.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
        3. Select **JWT**.
        4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
        5. Select **Generate new key**.
        6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
        Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:

        * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [User data format](/deploy/personalization-setup#user-data-format) for more information.
        * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
        * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` with an existing authentication system at `foo.com`. You want to extend your login flow to grant access to the docs while keeping your docs separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard).

    Create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that extends your existing authentication.

    After verifying user credentials:

    * Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
    * Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```ts TypeScript theme={null}
      import * as jose from 'jose';
      import { Request, Response } from 'express';

      const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

      const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

      export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
        const user = {
          expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
          groups: res.locals.user.groups,
          content: {
            firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
            lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
          },
        };

        const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
          .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
          .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
          .sign(signingKey);

        return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
      }
      ```

      ```python Python theme={null}
      import jwt # pyjwt
      import os

      from datetime import datetime, timedelta
      from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

      private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

      @router.get('/auth')
      async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
        jwt_token = jwt.encode(
          payload={
            'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
            'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
            'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
            'content': {
              'firstName': current_user.first_name,
              'lastName': current_user.last_name,
            },
          },
          key=private_key,
          algorithm='EdDSA'
        )

        return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    ### Redirect unauthenticated users

    When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, their intended destination is preserved in the redirect to your login URL:

    1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
    2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
    3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
    4. User lands in their original destination.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Make pages public

When using partial authentication, all pages are protected by default. You can make specific pages viewable without authentication at the page or group level with the `public` property.

### Individual pages

To make a page public, add `public: true` to the page's frontmatter.

```mdx Public page example theme={null}
---
title: "Public page"
public: true
---
```

### Groups of pages

To make all pages in a group public, add `"public": true` beneath the group's name in the `navigation` object of your `docs.json`.

```json Public group example theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Public group",
        "public": true,
        "icon": "play",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "installation",
          "settings"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Private group",
        "icon": "pause",
        "pages": [
          "private-information",
          "secret-settings"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Control access with groups

When you use OAuth or JWT authentication, you can restrict specific pages to certain user groups. This is useful when you want different users to see different content based on their role or attributes.

Groups are managed through user data passed during authentication.

```json Example user info highlight={2} theme={null}
{
  "groups": ["admin", "beta-users"],
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  }
}
```

Specify which groups can access specific pages using the `groups` property in frontmatter.

```mdx Example page restricted to the admin group highlight={3} theme={null}
---
title: "Admin dashboard"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```

Users must belong to at least one of the listed groups to access the page. If a user tries to access a page without the required group, they'll receive a 404 error.

### Interaction with authentication modes

Groups work differently depending on your authentication mode.

**Full authentication with groups:**

* All pages require authentication.
* Pages without a `groups` property are accessible to all authenticated users.
* Pages with a `groups` property are only accessible to authenticated users in those groups.

**Partial authentication with groups:**

* Pages require authentication unless you make them public.
* Pages with `public: true` and no `groups` are accessible to everyone.
* Pages with `groups` (with or without `public: true`) are only accessible to authenticated users in those groups.

```mdx Anyone can view this page theme={null}
---
title: "Public guide"
public: true
---
```

````mdx Only authenticated users can view this page theme={null}
---
title: "API reference"
---

```mdx Only authenticated users in the pro or enterprise groups can view this page
---
title: "Advanced configurations"
groups: ["pro", "enterprise"]

# CI checks
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/ci

Automate broken link checks, linting, and grammar validation in CI/CD.

<Info>
  [Pro and Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-ci) include CI checks for GitHub repositories.
</Info>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors and provide warnings before you deploy. Mintlify CI checks run on pull requests against a configured deployment branch.

## Installation

To begin, follow the steps on the [GitHub](/deploy/github) page.

<Tip>
  Only access to the repository where your documentation content exists is required, so it is highly recommended to only grant access to that repository.
</Tip>

## Configuration

Configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment by navigating to the [Add-ons](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/addons) page of your dashboard. Enable the checks that you want to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

* A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.
* A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if there is an error or suggestions.

## Available CI checks

### Broken links

Similar to how the [CLI link checker](/installation#find-broken-links) works on your local machine, the
broken link CI check automatically searches your documentation content for broken internal links.

To see the results of this check, visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX. Use Vale to check for consistency of style and tone in your documentation.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration

If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root content directory of your deployment, the Vale CI check uses that configuration file and any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

If you don't have a Vale config file, the default configuration automatically loads.

```mdx Default vale.ini configuration expandable theme={null}
# Top level styles
StylesPath = /app/styles
MinAlertLevel = suggestion
# Inline HTML tags to ignore (code/tt for code snippets, img/url for links/images, a for anchor tags)
IgnoredScopes = code, tt, img, url, a
SkippedScopes = script, style, pre, figure

# Vocabularies
Vocab = Mintlify

# Packages
Packages = MDX

# Only match MDX
[*.mdx]
BasedOnStyles = Vale
Vale.Terms = NO # Enforces really harsh capitalization rules, keep off

# Ignore JSX/MDX-specific syntax patterns
# `import ...`, `export ...`
# `<Component ... />`
# `<Component>...</Component>`
# `{ ... }`
TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

# Exclude multiline JSX and curly braces
# `<Component \n ... />`
BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

The default Vale vocabulary includes the following words.

To add your own vocabulary for the default configuration, create a `styles/config/vocabularies/Mintlify` directory with `accept.txt` and `reject.txt` files.

* `accept.txt`: Words that should be ignored by the Vale linter. For example, product names or uncommon terms.
* `reject.txt`: Words that should be flagged as errors. For example, jargon or words that are not appropriate for the tone of your documentation.

```text Example Vale file structure theme={null}
/your-project
  |- docs.json
  |- .vale.ini
  |- styles/
    |- config/
      |- vocabularies/
        |- Mintlify/
          |- accept.txt
          |- reject.txt
  |- example-page.mdx
```

```text Example monorepo Vale file structure theme={null}
/your-monorepo
  |- main.ts
  |- docs/
    |- docs.json
    |- .vale.ini
    |- styles/
      |- config/
      |- vocabularies/
        |- Mintlify/
          |- accept.txt
          |- reject.txt
    |- example-page.mdx
  |- test/
```

<Note>
  For security reasons, absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values aren't supported.

  Use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Note>

#### Packages

Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors. Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` are automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they're automatically downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Note>
  For security reasons, automatically downloading packages that aren't from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer) is **not** supported.
</Note>

#### Vale with `MDX`

<Note>
  MDX native support requires Vale 3.10.0 or later. Check your Vale version with `vale --version`.
</Note>

To use Vale's in-document comments in MDX files, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`:

```mdx  theme={null}
{/* vale off */}

This text is ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```

Vale automatically recognizes and respects these comments in MDX files without additional configuration. Use comments to skip lines or sections that should be ignored by the linter.


# Cloudflare
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/cloudflare

Host documentation at a subpath on Cloudflare Workers.

To host your documentation at a subpath such as `yoursite.com/docs` using Cloudflare, you must create and configure a Cloudflare Worker.

<Info>
  Before you begin, you need a Cloudflare account and a domain name (can be managed on or off Cloudflare).
</Info>

## Set up a Cloudflare Worker

Create a Cloudflare Worker by following the [Cloudflare Workers getting started guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/dashboard/), if you have not already.

<Tip>
  If your DNS provider is Cloudflare, disable proxying for the CNAME record to avoid potential configuration issues.
</Tip>

### Proxies with Vercel deployments

If you use Cloudflare as a proxy with Vercel deployments, you must ensure proper configuration to avoid conflicts with Vercel's domain verification and SSL certificate provisioning.

Improper proxy configuration can prevent Vercel from provisioning Let's Encrypt SSL certificates and cause domain verification failures.

#### Required path allowlist

Your Cloudflare Worker must allow traffic to these specific paths without blocking or redirecting:

* `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt certificate verification
* `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for Vercel domain verification

While Cloudflare automatically handles many verification rules, creating additional custom rules may inadvertently block this critical traffic.

#### Header forwarding requirements

Ensure that the `HOST` header is correctly forwarded in your Worker configuration. Failure to properly forward headers will cause verification requests to fail.

### Configure routing

In your Cloudflare dashboard, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code. See the [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/dashboard/#development) for more information on editing a Worker.

<Tip>
  Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain, `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL, and `/docs` with your desired subpath if different.
</Tip>

```javascript  theme={null}
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);

    // If the request is to a Vercel verification path, allow it to pass through
    if (urlObject.pathname.startsWith('/.well-known/')) {
      return await fetch(request);
    }

    // If the request is to the docs subpath
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");
      // If deploying to Vercel, preserve client IP
      proxyRequest.headers.set("CF-Connecting-IP", request.headers.get("CF-Connecting-IP"));

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // If no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Select **Deploy** and wait for the changes to propagate.

<Note>
  After configuring your DNS, custom subdomains are usually available within a few minutes. DNS propagation can sometimes take 1-4 hours, and in rare cases up to 48 hours. If your subdomain is not immediately available, please wait before troubleshooting.
</Note>

### Test your Worker

After your code deploys, test your Worker to ensure it routes to your Mintlify docs.

1. Test using the Worker's preview URL: `your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/docs`
2. Verify the Worker routes to your Mintlify docs and your website.

### Add custom domain

1. In your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/), navigate to your Worker.
2. Go to **Settings > Domains & Routes > Add > Custom Domain**.
3. Add your domain.

<Tip>
  We recommend you add your domain both with and without `www.` prepended.
</Tip>

See [Add a custom domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/#add-a-custom-domain) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.

### Resolve DNS conflicts

If your domain already points to another service, you must remove the existing DNS record. Your Cloudflare Worker must be configured to control all traffic for your domain.

1. Delete the existing DNS record for your domain. See [Delete DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#delete-dns-records) in the Cloudflare documentation for more information.
2. Return to your Worker and add your custom domain.

## Webflow custom routing

If you use Webflow to host your main site and want to serve Mintlify docs at `/docs` on the same domain, you'll need to configure custom routing through Cloudflare Workers to proxy all non-docs traffic to your main site.

<Warning>
  Make sure your main site is set up on a landing page before deploying this Worker, or visitors to your main site will see errors.
</Warning>

1. In Webflow, set up a landing page for your main site like `landing.yoursite.com`. This will be the page that visitors see when they visit your site.
2. Deploy your main site to the landing page. This ensures that your main site remains accessible while you configure the Worker.
3. To avoid conflicts, update any absolute URLs in your main site to be relative.
4. In Cloudflare, select **Edit Code** and add the following script into your Worker's code.

<Tip> Replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain, `[YOUR_DOMAIN]` with your website's base URL, `[LANDING_DOMAIN]` with your landing page URL, and `/docs` with your desired subpath if different. </Tip>

```javascript  theme={null}
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});
async function handleRequest(request) {
try {
  const urlObject = new URL(request.url);

  // If the request is to a Vercel verification path, allow it to pass through
  if (urlObject.pathname.startsWith('/.well-known/')) {
    return await fetch(request);
  }

  // If the request is to the docs subpath
  if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
    // Proxy to Mintlify
    const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
    const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";
    let url = new URL(request.url);
    url.hostname = DOCS_URL;
    let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);
    proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
    proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
    proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");
    // If deploying to Vercel, preserve client IP
    proxyRequest.headers.set("CF-Connecting-IP", request.headers.get("CF-Connecting-IP"));
    return await fetch(proxyRequest);
  }
  // Route everything else to main site
  const MAIN_SITE_URL = "[LANDING_DOMAIN]";
  if (MAIN_SITE_URL && MAIN_SITE_URL !== "[LANDING_DOMAIN]") {
    let mainSiteUrl = new URL(request.url);
    mainSiteUrl.hostname = MAIN_SITE_URL;
    return await fetch(mainSiteUrl, {
      method: request.method,
      headers: request.headers,
      body: request.body
    });
  }
} catch (error) {
  // If no action found, serve the regular request
  return await fetch(request);
}
}
```

5. Select **Deploy** and wait for the changes to propagate.

<Note>
  After configuring your DNS, custom subdomains are usually available within a few minutes. DNS propagation can sometimes take 1-4 hours, and in rare cases up to 48 hours. If your subdomain is not immediately available, please wait before troubleshooting.
</Note>


# Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/csp-configuration

Configure CSP headers to allow Mintlify resources while maintaining security for reverse proxies, firewalls, and networks that enforce strict security policies.

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by controlling which resources a web page can load. Mintlify serves a default CSP that protects most sites. If you host your documentation behind a reverse proxy or firewall, that overwrites the default CSP, you may need to configure CSP headers for features to function properly.

## CSP directives

The following CSP directives are used to control which resources can be loaded:

* `script-src`: Controls which scripts can be executed
* `style-src`: Controls which stylesheets can be loaded
* `font-src`: Controls which fonts can be loaded
* `img-src`: Controls which images, icons, and logos can be loaded
* `connect-src`: Controls which URLs can be connected to for API calls and WebSocket connections
* `frame-src`: Controls which URLs can be embedded in frames or iframes
* `default-src`: Fallback for other directives when not explicitly set

## Domain whitelist

| Domain                          | Purpose                        | CSP directive               | Required |

<Note>
  Only include domains for services that you use. Remove any analytics domains that you have not configured for your documentation.
</Note>

```text wrap theme={null}

frame-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev;
```

## Common configurations by proxy type

Most reverse proxies support adding custom headers.

### Cloudflare configuration

Create a Response Header Transform Rule:

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Rules > Overview**.
2. Select **Create rule > Response Header Transform Rule**.
3. Configure the rule:

* **Modify response header**: Set static
* **Header name**: `Content-Security-Policy`
* **Header value**:
  ```text wrap theme={null}
  default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: d3gk2c5xim1je2.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com cdn.jsdelivr.net; connect-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev *.mintlify.com d1ctpt7j8wusba.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com api.mintlifytrieve.com; frame-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev;
  ```

4. Deploy your rule.

### AWS CloudFront configuration

Add a response headers policy in CloudFront:

```json  theme={null}
{
"ResponseHeadersPolicy": {
    "Name": "MintlifyCSP",
    "Config": {
    "SecurityHeadersConfig": {
        "ContentSecurityPolicy": {
        "ContentSecurityPolicy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: d3gk2c5xim1je2.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com cdn.jsdelivr.net; connect-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev *.mintlify.com d1ctpt7j8wusba.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com api.mintlifytrieve.com; frame-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev;",
        "Override": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Vercel configuration

Add to your `vercel.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
"headers": [
    {
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "headers": [
        {
        "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
        "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' cdn.jsdelivr.net; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' d4tuoctqmanu0.cloudfront.net fonts.googleapis.com; img-src 'self' data: blob: d3gk2c5xim1je2.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com cdn.jsdelivr.net; connect-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev *.mintlify.com d1ctpt7j8wusba.cloudfront.net mintcdn.com *.mintcdn.com api.mintlifytrieve.com; frame-src 'self' *.mintlify.dev;"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Identify CSP violations in your browser console:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools.
2. Go to the **Console** tab.
3. Look for errors starting with:
   * `Content Security Policy: The page's settings blocked the loading of a resource`
   * `Refused to load the script/stylesheet because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive`
   * `Refused to connect to because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive`


# Deployments
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/deployments

Manage deployments, view history, and monitor status.

Your documentation site automatically deploys when you push changes to your connected repository. This requires the Mintlify GitHub app to be properly installed and connected.

If your latest changes are not appearing on your live site, first check that the GitHub app is installed on the account or organization that owns your docs repository. See [GitHub troubleshooting](/deploy/github#troubleshooting) for more information.

If the GitHub app is connected, but changes are still not deploying, you can manually trigger a rebuild from your dashboard.

## Manually triggering a deployment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your latest commit was successful.">
    Check that your latest commit appears in your docs repository and did not encounter any errors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manually trigger a deployment.">
    Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and select the deploy button.

# Overview
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/docs-subpath

Host your documentation at the `/docs` subpath on your domain.

Host your documentation at a subpath like `your-domain.com/docs` to keep your docs on your main domain, which makes them easier to find and maintains a cohesive brand experience for your users.

## Set up by hosting provider

Setting up a `/docs` subpath varies depending on your hosting provider. Choose your hosting provider and follow the setup instructions.

* [Cloudflare](/deploy/cloudflare): Set up Cloudflare Workers for your domain to serve your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.
* [AWS Route 53 and CloudFront](/deploy/route53-cloudfront): Deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath using AWS with Route 53 DNS and CloudFront CDN.
* [Vercel](/deploy/vercel#host-from-docs) - Use rewrites to deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.
* [Custom reverse proxy](/deploy/reverse-proxy) - For other hosting platforms, set up a reverse proxy to deploy your documentation at the `/docs` subpath.

### Additional configuration for strict security policies

If you proxy all traffic on your custom domain, you may need to configure [headers](/deploy/csp-configuration) added by your proxy or firewalls to ensure that your documentation is served correctly.

## Custom subpaths

If you need your documentation at a subpath other than `/docs` (for example, `/help` or `/guides`), contact the [Mintlify team](mailto:support@mintlify.com) with details about your desired path and hosting setup.


# GitHub Enterprise Server
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/ghes

Set up the GitHub App on your GitHub Enterprise Server installation.

This guide walks you through setting up the Mintlify GitHub App on your GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) installation. To connect a GHES instance to Mintlify, you must create a local version of our app within your self-hosted environment that communicates with our remote server.

If you use a cloud-hosted GitHub instance, see the [GitHub](/deploy/github) page for setup instructions.

## Prerequisites

## Permissions

When you install the GitHub app, you will be prompted to grant the following permissions:

Read permissions:

* `metadata`: Basic repository information

Read and write permissions:

* `checks`: Create status checks on pull requests
* `code`: Read file changes when you commit to your docs branch
* `deployments`: Generate preview deployments for pull requests
* `pull requests`: Create branches and pull requests from the web editor

<Info>
  The app only accesses repositories that you explicitly grant it access to. If you have branch protection rules enabled, the app can't push directly to protected branches.
</Info>

## Managing repository access

When installing our GitHub App, you can grant access to all of your repositories or specific ones. We recommend only granting access to the repositories where your documentation is located. You can modify this selection anytime in your [GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Configuring docs source

Change the organization, repository, or branch that your documentation is built from in the [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) section of your dashboard.

## GitHub Enterprise with IP allowlists

If your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization has an IP allowlist enabled, you need to add Mintlify's egress IP address (`54.242.90.151`) to your allowlist for the GitHub App to function properly.

Follow [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization) to configure your IP allowlist.

# GitLab
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/gitlab

Connect to a GitLab repository for automated deployments and preview builds.

We use access tokens and webhooks to authenticate and sync changes between GitLab and Mintlify.

* Mintlify uses access tokens to pull information from GitLab.
* GitLab uses webhooks to notify Mintlify when changes are made, enabling preview deployments for merge requests.

## Set up the connection

<Note>
  **HTTPS cloning required**: Your GitLab project must have HTTPS cloning enabled for Mintlify to access your repository. You can verify this in GitLab by going to your project's **Settings** > **General** > **Visibility and access controls** section.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your project ID">
    In your GitLab project, navigate to **Settings** > **General** and locate your **Project ID**.

# Personalization setup
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/personalization-setup

Show custom content based on user authentication and profile data.

Personalization customizes your documentation for each user when they are logged in. For example, you can prefill their API keys, show content specific to their plan or role, or hide sections they don't need access to.

## Personalization features

Customize content with these personalization capabilities.

### API key prefilling

Automatically populate API playground fields with user-specific values by returning matching field names in your user data. The field names in your user data must exactly match the names in the API playground for automatic prefilling to work.

### Dynamic MDX content

Display dynamic content based on user information like name, plan, or organization using the `user` variable.

```jsx  theme={null}
Welcome back, {user.firstName}! Your {user.org?.plan} plan includes...
```

See the [User data format](#user-data-format) section below for detailed examples and implementation guidance.

### Page visibility

Restrict which pages are visible to your users by adding `groups` fields to your pages' frontmatter. By default, every page is visible to every user.

Users will only see pages for `groups` that they are in.

```mdx  theme={null}
---
title: "Managing your users"
description: "Adding and removing users from your organization"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```

## User data format

When implementing personalization, your system returns user data in a specific format that enables content customization. This data can be sent as either a raw JSON object or within a signed JWT, depending on your handshake method. The shape of the data is the same for both.

```tsx  theme={null}
type User = {
  expiresAt?: number;
  groups?: string[];
  content?: Record<string, any>;
  apiPlaygroundInputs?: {
    header?: Record<string, any>;
    query?: Record<string, any>;
    cookie?: Record<string, any>;
    server?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

<ParamField path="expiresAt" type="number">
  Session expiration time in **seconds since epoch**. If the user loads a page after this time, their stored data is automatically deleted and they must reauthenticate.
  <Warning><b>For JWT handshakes:</b> This differs from the JWT's `exp` claim, which determines when a JWT is considered invalid. Set the JWT `exp` claim to a short duration (10 seconds or less) for security. Use `expiresAt` for the actual session length (hours to weeks).</Warning>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="groups" type="string[]">
  List of groups the user belongs to. Pages with matching `groups` in their frontmatter are visible to this user.

  **Example**: User with `groups: ["admin", "engineering"]` can access pages tagged with either the `admin` or `engineering` groups.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="content" type="object">
  Custom data accessible in your MDX content via the `user` variable. Use this for dynamic personalization throughout your documentation.

  **Basic example**:

  ```json  theme={null}
  { "firstName": "Ronan", "company": "Acme Corp", "plan": "Enterprise" }
  ```

  **Usage in MDX**:

  ```mdx  theme={null}
  Welcome back, {user.firstName}! Your {user.plan} plan includes...
  ```

  With the example `user` data, this would render as: Welcome back, Ronan! Your Enterprise plan includes...

  **Advanced conditional rendering**:

  ```jsx  theme={null}
  Authentication is an enterprise feature. {
    user.org === undefined
      ? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
      : user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
        ? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. See <a href="https://mintlify.com/pricing">our pricing page</a> for information about upgrading.</>
        : <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, contact your admin.</>
  }
  ```

  <Note>
    The information in `user` is only available for logged-in users. For logged-out users, the value of `user` will be `{}`. To prevent the page from crashing for logged-out users, always use optional chaining on your `user` fields. For example, `{user.org?.plan}`.
  </Note>
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="apiPlaygroundInputs" type="object">
  User-specific values that prefill API playground fields. Saves users time by auto-populating their data when testing APIs.

  **Example**:

  ```json  theme={null}
  {
    "header": { "X-API-Key": "user_api_key_123" },
    "server": { "subdomain": "foo" },
    "query": { "org_id": "12345" }
  }
  ```

  If a user makes requests at a specific subdomain, you can send `{ server: { subdomain: 'foo' } }` as an `apiPlaygroundInputs` field. This value will be prefilled on any API page with the `subdomain` value.

  <Note>The `header`, `query`, and `cookie` fields will only prefill if they are part of your [OpenAPI security scheme](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/). If a field is in either the `Authorization` or `Server` sections, it will prefill. Creating a standard header parameter named `Authorization` will not enable this feature.</Note>
</ParamField>

### Example user data

```json  theme={null}
{
  "expiresAt": 1735689600,
  "groups": ["admin", "beta-users"],
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "company": "TechCorp",
    "plan": "Enterprise",
    "region": "us-west"
  },
  "apiPlaygroundInputs": {
    "header": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer abc123",
      "X-Org-ID": "techcorp"
    },
    "server": {
      "environment": "production",
      "region": "us-west"
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuring personalization

Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="JWT">
    ### Prerequisites

    * A login system that can generate and sign JWTs
    * A backend service that can create redirect URLs

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Generate a private key.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Personalization**.
        3. Select **JWT**.
        4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
        5. Select **Generate new key**.
        6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Integrate Mintlify personalization into your login flow.">
        Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user login:

        * Create a JWT containing the logged-in user's info in the `User` format. See the [User data format](#user-data-format) section above for more information.
        * Sign the JWT with the secret key, using the ES256 algorithm.
        * Create a redirect URL back to your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com`. You want your docs to be separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard) and enable personalization.

    Generate a JWT secret. Then create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow to your documentation.

    After verifying user credentials:

    * Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
    * Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

    ```ts  theme={null}
    import * as jose from 'jose';
    import { Request, Response } from 'express';

    const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

    const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'ES256');

    export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
      const user = {
        expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000),
        groups: res.locals.user.groups,
        content: {
          firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
          lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
        },
      };

      const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
        .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'ES256' })
        .setExpirationTime('10 s')
        .sign(signingKey);

      return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com#${jwt}`);
    }
    ```

    ### Preserving page anchors

    To redirect users to specific sections after login, use this URL format: `https://docs.foo.com/page#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor={ANCHOR}`.

    **Example**:

    * Original URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#step-one`
    * Redirect URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor=step-one`
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
    ### Prerequisites

    * An OAuth server that supports the Auth Code with PKCE Flow
    * Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens

    ### Implementation

        Create an API endpoint that:

        * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
        * Returns user data in the `User` format. See the [User data format](#user-data-format) section above for more information.
        * Defines the scopes for access.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your OAuth personalization settings.">
        1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Select **Personalization**.
        3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:

        * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth authorization endpoint.
        * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
        * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Copy the **entire** scope string (for example, for a scope like `provider.users.docs`, copy the complete `provider.users.docs`). Must match the scopes of the endpoint that you configured in the first step.
        * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
        * **Info API URL**: Endpoint to retrieve user data for personalization. Created in the first step.

        4. Select **Save changes**
      </Step>

      <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
        1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
        2. Add this URL as an authorized redirect URL in your OAuth server configuration.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ### Example

    Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow. You want to personalize your docs based on user data.

    **Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `provider.users.docs` scope and responds with the user's custom data:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "content": {
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "lastName": "Doe"
      },
      "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
    }
    ```

    **Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:

    * **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
    * **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
    * **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
    * **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
    * **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

    **Configure your OAuth server** to allow redirects to your callback URL.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Shared session">
    ### Prerequisites

    * A dashboard or user portal with cookie-based session authentication.
    * Ability to create an API endpoint at the same origin or subdomain as your dashboard.
      * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
      * If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`.
    * Your docs are hosted at the same domain or subdomain as your dashboard.
      * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
      * If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.

    ### Implementation

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
        Create an API endpoint that:

        * Uses your existing session authentication to identify users
        * Returns user data in the `User` format (see the [User data format](#user-data-format) section above)
        * If the API domain and the docs domain **do not exactly match**:
          * Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`).
          * Set your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`.
          <Warning>
            Only enable CORS headers on this specific endpoint, not your entire dashboard API.
          </Warning>
      </Step>

    ### Examples

    #### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

    You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

    **Setup process**:

    1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
    2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
       * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://docs.foo.com`
       * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
    3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

    #### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

    You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

    **Setup process**:

    1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
    2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
       * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://foo.com`
       * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
    3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

    #### Dashboard at root, docs at root

    You have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

    **Setup process**:

    1. **Create endpoint** `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
    2. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info`

    <Note>
      No CORS configuration is needed since the dashboard and docs share the same domain.

## Troubleshooting preview deployments

If your preview deployment fails, try these troubleshooting steps.

* **View the build logs**: In your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/), go to **Previews** and click the failed preview. The deployment logs show errors that caused failures.
* **Check your configuration**:
  * Invalid `docs.json` syntax
  * Missing or incorrect file paths referenced in your navigation
  * Invalid frontmatter in MDX files
  * Broken image links or missing image files
* **Validate locally**: Run `mint dev` locally to catch build errors before pushing to the repository.
* **Check recent changes**: Review the most recent commits in your branch to identify what changes caused the build to fail.


# Reverse proxy
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/reverse-proxy

Configure a custom reverse proxy to serve your documentation.

<Note>
  Reverse proxy configurations are only supported for [Custom plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=reverse-proxy).
</Note>

To serve your documentation through a custom reverse proxy, you must configure routing rules, caching policies, and header forwarding.

When you implement a reverse proxy, monitor for potential issues with domain verification, SSL certificate provisioning, authentication flows, performance, and analytics tracking.

## Routing configuration

Proxy these paths to your Mintlify subdomain with the specified caching policies:

| Path                              | Destination                     | Caching       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*`   | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | No cache      |
| `/.well-known/vercel/*`           | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | No cache      |
| `/mintlify-assets/_next/static/*` | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | Cache enabled |
| `/_mintlify/*`                    | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | No cache      |
| `/*`                              | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | No cache      |
| `/`                               | `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app` | No cache      |

## Required header configuration

Configure your reverse proxy with these header requirements:

* **Origin**: Contains the target subdomain `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app`
* **X-Forwarded-For**: Preserves client IP information
* **X-Forwarded-Proto**: Preserves original protocol (HTTP/HTTPS)
* **X-Real-IP**: Forwards the real client IP address
* **User-Agent**: Forwards the user agent

<Warning>
  Ensure that the `Host` header is not forwarded
</Warning>

## Example nginx configuration

```nginx  theme={null}
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name <your-domain>.com;

    # Let's Encrypt verification paths
    location ~ ^/\.well-known/acme-challenge/ {

        # Disable caching for Mintlify paths
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
    }

    # Root path

        # Disable caching for dynamic content
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
    }

    # All other documentation paths
    location / {
        proxy_pass https://<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app;
        proxy_set_header Origin <your-subdomain>.mintlify.app;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

        proxy_set_header User-Agent $http_user_agent;

        # Disable caching for dynamic content
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate";
    }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### 404 error

**Symptoms**: Documentation loads, but features don't work. API calls fail.

**Cause**: `Host` header is being forwarded or `Origin` header is missing.

**Solution**:

* Remove `Host` header forwarding
* Set `Origin` header to `<your-subdomain>.mintlify.app`

### Performance issues

**Symptoms**: Slow page loads and layout shifts.

**Cause**: Incorrect caching configuration.

**Solution**: Enable caching only for `/mintlify-assets/_next/static/*` paths.


# AWS Route 53 and CloudFront
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/route53-cloudfront

Deploy documentation at a subpath on AWS with Route 53 DNS and CloudFront CDN.

To host your documentation at a subpath such as `yoursite.com/docs` using AWS Route 53 and CloudFront, you must configure your DNS provider to point to your CloudFront distribution.

## Overview

Route traffic to these paths with a Cache Policy of **CachingDisabled**:

* `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt certificate verification
* `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for domain verification
* `/docs/*` - Required for subpath routing
* `/docs/` - Required for subpath routing

Route traffic to this path with a Cache Policy of **CachingEnabled**:

* `/mintlify-assets/_next/static/*`

2. Find your staging URL that mirrors the main domain. This is highly variant depending on how your landing page is hosted. For example, the Mintlify staging URL is [mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app](https://mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app).

<Info>
  If your landing page is hosted on Webflow, use Webflow's staging URL. It would look like `.webflow.io`.

  If you use Vercel, use the `.vercel.app` domain available for every project.
</Info>

3. Create a new Origin and add your staging URL as the "Origin domain."

## Set behaviors

Behaviors in CloudFront enable control over the subpath logic. At a high level, we're looking to create the following logic:

* **If a user lands on your custom subpath**, go to `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev`.
* **If a user lands on any other page**, go the current landing page.

1. Navigate to the "Behaviors" tab of your CloudFront distribution.

2. Select the **Create behavior** button and create the following behaviors.

### `/.well-known/*`

Create behaviors for Vercel domain verification paths with a **Path pattern** of `/.well-known/*` and set **Origin and origin groups** to your docs URL.

For "Cache policy," select **CachingDisabled** to ensure these verification requests pass through without caching.

<Info>
  If `.well-known/*` is too generic, it can be narrowed down to 2 behaviors at a minimum for Vercel:

  * `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for Vercel domain verification
  * `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt certificate verification
</Info>

### Your subpath

Create a behavior with a **Path pattern** of your chosen subpath, for example `/docs`, with **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the `.mintlify.dev` URL (in our case `acme.mintlify.dev`).

* Set "Cache policy" to **CachingOptimized**.
* Set "Origin request policy" to **AllViewerExceptHostHeader**.

### Your subpath with wildcard

Create a behavior with a **Path pattern** of your chosen subpath followed by `/*`, for example `/docs/*`, and **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the same `.mintlify.dev` URL.

These settings should exactly match your base subpath behavior. With the exception of the **Path pattern**.

* Set "Cache policy" to **CachingOptimized**.
* Set "Origin request policy" to **AllViewerExceptHostHeader**.
* Set "Viewer protocol policy" to **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**

### `/mintlify-assets/_next/static/*`

* Set "Cache policy" to **CachingOptimized**
* Set "Origin request policy" to **AllViewerExceptHostHeader**
* Set "Viewer protocol policy" to **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**

### `Default (*)`

Lastly, we're going to edit the `Default (*)` behavior.

## Preview distribution

You can now test if your distribution is set up properly by going to the "General" tab and visiting the **Distribution domain name** URL.

</Frame>

All pages should be directing to your main landing page, but if you append your chosen subpath, for example `/docs`, to the URL, you should see it going to your Mintlify documentation instance.

## Connect with Route53

Now, we're going to bring the functionality of the CloudFront distribution into your primary domain.

<Note>
  For this section, you can also refer to AWS's official guide on [Configuring
  Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to a CloudFront
  distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html#routing-to-cloudfront-distribution-config)
</Note>

1. Navigate to [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) inside the AWS console.
2. Navigate to the "Hosted zone" for your primary domain.
3. Select **Create record**.

</Frame>

5. Select **Create records**.

<Note>
  You may need to remove the existing A record if one currently exists.
</Note>

Your documentation is now live at your chosen subpath for your primary domain.

<Note>
  After configuring your DNS, custom subdomains are usually available within a few minutes. DNS propagation can sometimes take 1-4 hours, and in rare cases up to 48 hours. If your subdomain is not immediately available, please wait before troubleshooting.

Configure your `vercel.json` file to proxy requests from your main domain to your documentation at a subpath.

## vercel.json file

The `vercel.json` file configures how your project builds and deploys. It sits in your project's root directory and controls various aspects of your deployment, including routing, redirects, headers, and build settings.

We use the `rewrites` configuration in your `vercel.json` file to proxy requests from your main domain to your documentation.

Rewrites map incoming requests to different destinations without changing the URL in the browser. When someone visits `yoursite.com/docs`, Vercel internally fetches content from `your-subdomain.mintlify.dev/docs`, but the user still sees `yoursite.com/docs` in their browser. This is different from redirects, which send users to another URL entirely.

## Configuration

### Host at `/docs` subpath

1. Navigate to [Custom domain setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard.
2. Click the **Host at `/docs`** toggle to the on position.

3. Enter your domain.
4. Select **Add domain**.
5. Add the following rewrites to your `vercel.json` file. Replace `[subdomain]` with your subdomain, which is found at the end of your dashboard URL. For example, `dashboard.mintlify.com/your-organization/your-subdomain` has a domain identifier of `your-subdomain`.

   ```json  theme={null}
   {
     "rewrites": [
       {
         "source": "/docs",
         "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs"
       },
       {
         "source": "/docs/:match*",
         "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs/:match*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

The `rewrites` configuration maps the `/docs` subpath on your domain to the `/docs` subpath on your documentation.

* **`source`**: The path pattern on your domain that triggers the rewrite.
* **`destination`**: Where the request should be proxied to.
* **`:match*`**: A wildcard that captures any path segments after your subpath.

For more information, see [Configuring projects with vercel.json: Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites) in the Vercel documentation.

### Host at custom subpath

<Note>
  Custom subpaths require a Custom plan and manual setup. Contact [Mintlify support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) with details about your desired subpath and hosting setup.
</Note>

To use a custom subpath (any path other than `/docs`), you must organize your documentation files within your repository to match your subpath structure. For example, if your documentation is hosted at `yoursite.com/help`, your documentation files must be in a `help/` directory.

Use the generator below to create your rewrites configuration. Add the rewrites to your `vercel.json` file.

# External proxies with Vercel
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/deploy/vercel-external-proxies

Configure external proxies in front of your Vercel deployment.

If you have an external proxy like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront in front of your Vercel deployment, you must configure it properly to avoid conflicts with Vercel's domain verification and SSL certificate provisioning.

Improper proxy configuration can prevent Vercel from provisioning Let's Encrypt SSL certificates and cause domain verification failures.

See the [supported providers](https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-setup-verified-proxy#supported-providers-verified-proxy-lite) in the Vercel documentation.

## Required path allowlist

Your external proxy must allow traffic to these specific paths without blocking, redirecting, or heavily caching:

* `/.well-known/acme-challenge/*` - Required for Let's Encrypt certificate verification
* `/.well-known/vercel/*` - Required for Vercel domain verification
* `/mintlify-assets/_next/static/*` - Required for static assets

These paths should pass through directly to your Vercel deployment without modification.

## Header forwarding requirements

Ensure that your proxy correctly forwards the `HOST` header. Without proper header forwarding, verification requests will fail.

## Testing your proxy setup

To verify your proxy is correctly configured:

1. Test that `https://[yourdomain].com/.well-known/vercel/` returns a response.
2. Ensure SSL certificates are provisioning correctly in your Vercel dashboard.
3. Check that domain verification completes successfully.

Access the visual editor from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/editor) to manage your documentation directly in your browser.

* **WYSIWYG editing**: Make changes to your documentation using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor that shows how your content will look when published.
* **Git synchronization**: All changes automatically sync with your Git repository to maintain version control.
* **Team collaboration**: Multiple people can work on documentation simultaneously.
* **Component integration**: Add callouts, code blocks, and other components with slash commands.
* **No setup required**: Start writing immediately from your dashboard.

## Overview

Here is how you'll typically work in the visual editor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose your branch">
    Create a branch or make changes directly to your deployment branch. We recommend creating a branch so that you can preview your changes before they go live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open your file">
    Navigate to an existing file in the sidebar or create a new one using the file explorer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit your content">
    Make changes in the visual editor. Press <kbd>/</kbd>

    to open the component menu.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview your changes">
    Visual mode shows you how your changes will appear on your live site. Use this to verify everything looks correct.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your changes">
    If you're working on your deployment branch, publish your changes directly from the visual editor. On other branches, you'll create a pull request for review before publishing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor modes

The visual editor has two modes to accommodate different editing preferences and needs: visual mode and Markdown mode.

Use the mode toggle in the editor toolbar to switch modes.

### Organize your navigation

Edit your `docs.json` file to add new pages and remove deleted pages from your site navigation. See [Navigation](/organize/navigation) for more information on how to organize pages.

**Example: Add a Themes page to the Profile group**

In this example, you created a new page titled Themes and you want to add it to the Profile group in your documentation. Add the path to the new page to the `pages` array of the `Profile` group in your `docs.json` file for it to appear in your site navigation.

```json Adding a Themes page to the Profile group {18} theme={null}
{
    "navigation": {
        "groups": [
            {
                "group": "Getting started",
                "pages": [
                    "index",
                    "quickstart",
                    "installation"
                ]
            },
            {
                "group": "Profile",
                "pages": [
                    "settings",
                    "account-types",
                    "dashboard",
                    "themes"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

In Markdown mode, you can directly edit the MDX of your pages. This can be helpful when you need to:

* Set specific component properties
* Work with complex nested components
* Copy and paste MDX content from other sources

See [Format text](/create/text) and [Format code](/create/code) for more information on how to write using MDX syntax.

## Publish your changes

The branch that you work on determines how the editor publishes your changes:

* **Deployment branch**: Publishing updates your live site immediately.
* **Other branches**: Publishing creates a pull request so you can review changes before deploying them to production.

* **Thumbs rating only**: Simple thumbs up/down voting to gauge overall satisfaction with pages.
* **Code snippet feedback only**: Feedback specifically on code snippets.
* **Thumbs rating and contextual feedback**: Page voting plus detailed comments and reasons for ratings.
* **Thumbs rating and code snippet feedback**: Page voting plus feedback on code examples.
* **Thumbs rating, contextual, and code snippet feedback**: Complete feedback system with page voting, detailed comments, and code snippet feedback.

<Note>
  If you disable telemetry in your `docs.json` file, feedback features will not appear on your documentation pages, even if you enable them in your dashboard.
</Note>

## Managing feedback

For contextual and code snippet feedback, you can set the status of a piece of feedback and add internal notes to track your work resolving user feedback.

### Changing feedback status

Select the status beside a piece of feedback to mark it as **Pending**, **In Progress**, **Resolved**, or **Dismissed**.

Best practices for setting feedback statuses:

* **Pending**: Feedback is awaiting review.
* **In Progress**: Feedback has been validated and is being worked on.
* **Resolved**: Feedback has been resolved.
* **Dismissed**: Feedback has been dismissed as not actionable, irrelevant, or inaccurate.

### Filtering by status

Use the status filter to control which feedback is displayed. Clear a status to hide all feedback with that status. By default, all feedback is displayed.

### Adding internal notes

Click on a piece of feedback to add an internal note. These notes are only visible to people with access to your dashboard.

Use notes to add information for collaboration, link relevant support or engineering tickets, or remember any other useful information.

## Using feedback data

Review your feedback data to:

* **Identify successful content**: Pages with the most positive feedback show what works well in your documentation.
* **Prioritize improvements**: Pages with the most negative feedback indicate what content might need attention.
* **Take action**: Make documentation updates based on direct user feedback.


# Overview

Use the CLI to preview your documentation locally as you write and edit. View changes in real-time before deploying, test your documentation site's appearance and functionality, and catch issues like broken links or accessibility problems.

The CLI also has utilities for maintaining your documentation, including commands to rename files, validate OpenAPI specifications, and migrate content between formats.

## Install the CLI

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher through v24. LTS versions are preferred.
</Info>

Run the following command to install the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint):

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Preview locally

To generate a local preview, navigate to your documentation directory (where your `docs.json` file is located) and run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint dev
```

A local preview of your documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally, you can run a one-time script:

```bash  theme={null}
npx mint dev
```

### Custom ports

By default, the CLI uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. To run the CLI on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that is already in use, it will use the next available port:

```mdx  theme={null}
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Skip OpenAPI processing

If you have many OpenAPI files, skip OpenAPI file processing during local development to improve performance by using the `--disable-openapi` flag:

```bash  theme={null}
mint dev --disable-openapi
```

### Preview as a specific group

If you use partial authentication to restrict access to your documentation, you can preview as a specific authentication group by using the `--groups [groupname]` flag.

For example, if you have a group named `admin`, you can preview as a member of that group with the command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint dev --groups admin
```

## Create a new project

To create a new documentation project, run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint new [directory]
```

This command clones the [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) into a specified directory. If no directory is specified, the CLI tool prompts you to create a new subdirectory or overwrite the current directory.

<Warning>
  If you overwrite the current directory, any existing files in the directory will be deleted.
</Warning>

The CLI tool prompts you for a project name and [theme](/customize/themes) to finish setting up your project.

You can run `mint new` with the following flags:

* `--theme`: Set the theme of the new project.
* `--name`: Set the name of the new project.
* `--force`: Overwrite the current directory if it already exists.

For example, to create a new project in the `docs` directory with the name `my-project` and the theme `linden`, run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint new docs --name my-project --theme linden
```

## Update the CLI

If your local preview is out of sync with what you see on the web in the production version, update your local CLI:

```bash  theme={null}
mint update
```

If this `mint update` command is not available on your local version, re-install the CLI with the latest version:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm i -g mint@latest
  ```

  ```bash pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm add -g mint@latest
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Additional commands

### Find broken links

Identify any broken internal links with the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint broken-links
```

The command ignores files matching [.mintignore](/organize/mintignore) patterns. Links that point to ignored files are reported as broken.

### Find accessibility issues

Test the color contrast ratios and search for missing alt text on images and videos in your documentation with the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint a11y
```

### Check OpenAPI spec

Check your OpenAPI file for errors with the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint openapi-check <OpenAPI filename or URL>
```

Pass a filename (for example, `./openapi.yaml`) or a URL (for example, `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Rename files

Rename and update all references to files with the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint rename <path/to/old-filename> <path/to/new-filename>
```

### Migrate MDX endpoint pages

Migrate MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages from your OpenAPI specification with the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint migrate-mdx
```

This command converts individual MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages defined in your `docs.json`, moves MDX content to the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification, and updates your navigation. See [Migrating from MDX](/guides/migrating-from-mdx) for detailed information.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions in your IDE to recognize and format MDX files.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code, we recommend the [MDX VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend the [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Error: Could not load the &#x22;sharp&#x22; module using the darwin-arm64 runtime">
    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:

    1. Remove the currently-installed version of the mint CLI: `npm uninstall -g mint`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js.
    3. Reinstall the mint CLI: `npm install -g mint`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
    **Solution**: Go to the root of your device and delete the `~/.mintlify` folder. Afterwards, run `mint dev` again.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error: permission denied">
    This is due to not having the required permissions to globally install node packages.

    **Solution**: Try running `sudo npm i -g mint`. You will be prompted for your password, which is the one you use to unlock your computer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The local preview doesn't look the same as my docs do on the web">
    This is likely due to an outdated version of the CLI.

    **Solution:** Run `mint update` to get the latest changes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="mintlify vs. mint package">
    If you have any problems with the CLI package, you should first run `npm ls -g`. This command shows what packages are globally installed on your machine.

    If you don't use npm or don't see it in the -g list, try `which mint` to locate the installation.

    If you have a package named `mint` and a package named `mintlify` installed, you should uninstall `mintlify`.

    1. Uninstall the old package:

    ```bash  theme={null}
      npm uninstall -g mintlify
    ```

    2. Clear your npm cache:

    ```bash  theme={null}
      npm cache clean --force
    ```

    3. Reinstall the new package:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm i -g mint
    ```

# Google Analytics 4
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/integrations/analytics/google-analytics

Track visitor behavior and engagement with Google Analytics.

You will need to generate a new <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property to use with Mintlify. The data collected will go into the same project as your other Google Analytics data.

If you are using the old version of Google Analytics, Universal Analytics, you will still be able to generate a <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property. <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> data is slightly different from UA data but still gets collected in the same project.

## How to Connect GA4 to Mintlify

### Create a Web Stream

You will need to create a web stream to get the Measurement ID to put into Mintlify.

Click the cog at the bottom left of the Google Analytics screen. Then click on Data Streams.

Create a Web Stream and put the URL of your Mintlify docs site as the stream URL.

Your Measurement ID looks like `G-XXXXXXX` and will show up under Stream Details immediately after you create the Web Stream.

### Put Measurement ID in docs.json

Add your Measurement ID to your `docs.json` file like so:

```json docs.json theme={null}
"integrations": {
    "ga4": {
        "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXX"
    }
}
```

### Wait

Google Analytics takes two to three days to show your data.

You can use the [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) to check analytics are enabled correctly. The extension will log to your browser's console every time GA4 makes a request.

<Note>
  Preview links have analytics turned off.

    If your documentation is hosted on another platform, see the manual migration steps.

    ### Installing the scraper

    Install the `@mintlify/scraping` package to get started.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm install @mintlify/scraping@latest -g
    ```

    ### Scraping pages and sections

    The migration tool automatically detects your documentation platform and converts your content. Prepared files are stored locally in `./docs` by default.

    For large documentation sites, migrate smaller sections at a time rather than the entire site at once.

    **Migrate entire sections:**

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mintlify-scrape section https://your-docs-site.com/docs
    ```

    **Migrate single pages:**

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mintlify-scrape page https://your-docs-site.com/docs/getting-started
    ```

    **Migrate OpenAPI specifications:**

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mintlify-scrape openapi-file [openApiFilename]
    ```

    ### Add prepared content to your Mintlify project

    After scraping your existing documentation platform, you are ready to build your docs on Mintlify.

    Confirm that all of your pages have been migrated then add these files to the documentation repository that you created during the onboarding process. This is usually a GitHub repository.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual migration">
    Migrate your documentation from any platform with full control over the process.

    ### Content migration

    To migrate your content to Mintlify, you will need:

    * A valid `docs.json` for your site settings and navigation. See [Global settings](/organize/settings) and [Navigation](/organize/navigation) for more information.
    * A Markdown file (`.md` or `.mdx`) for each page of your documentation. MDX is the recommended format. See [Pages](/organize/pages) for more information.
    * (Optional) An OpenAPI specification for your API endpoint pages. See [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup) for more information.

    1. If your content is already in Markdown format, copy the content to your Mintlify project. Otherwise, convert your content to MDX format.
    2. Create your `docs.json` referencing the paths to your Markdown pages.
    3. If you have OpenAPI specifications, add them to your `docs.json` and configure the API playground.

    <Tip>
      If you migrate your content as `.md` files, convert them to `.mdx` to support interactive features like React components.
    </Tip>

    ### Asset migration

    1. Copy assets to your repository's `images/` directory.
    2. Update references in your Markdown files:
       ```mdx  theme={null}
       ![Alt text](/images/screenshot.png)
       ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Post-migration checklist

After completing your migration (automated or manual), we recommend checking:

* All pages render
* Navigation works as intended
* Internal links resolve properly
* Images and assets load correctly
* Code blocks display with proper syntax highlighting
* Search functionality works
* Deployment is configured
* Custom domain is set up

# SEO
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/optimize/seo

Optimize SEO with meta tag configuration for better search visibility.

Mintlify automatically handles many SEO best practices, including:

* Meta tag generation
* Sitemap and `robots.txt` file generation
* Semantic HTML structure
* Mobile optimization

You can fully customize your site's meta tags by adding the `metatags` field to your `docs.json` or a page's frontmatter.

## Automatically generated meta tags

Mintlify generates the following meta tags for every page. You can override these meta tags by specifying them in your `docs.json` or a page's frontmatter.

**Basic metadata:**

* `charset: utf-8` - Character encoding
* `og:type: website` - Open Graph type
* `og:site_name` - Your documentation site name
* `twitter:card: summary_large_image` - Twitter card type

**Page-specific metadata:**

* `title` - Page title, formatted as "Page Title - Site Name"
* `og:title` - Open Graph title, same as page title
* `twitter:title` - Twitter title, same as page title
* `description` - Page description
* `og:description` - Open Graph description, same as page description
* `twitter:description` - Twitter description, same as page description

**URL and canonical:**

* `canonical` - Automatically built from page URL
* `og:url` - Set to canonical URL

**SEO and indexing:**

* `robots` - Generated from page metadata
* `noindex` - Generated from page metadata
* `keywords` - Generated from page metadata

**Images:**

* `og:image` - Open Graph image, `og:image:width` set to 1200 and `og:image:height` 630
* `twitter:image` - Twitter image, `twitter:image:width` set to 1200 and `twitter:image:height` 630

**Browser and app metadata:**

* `applicationName` - Your documentation site name
* `generator: Mintlify` - Identifies the site generator as Mintlify
* `apple-mobile-web-app-title` - iOS home screen app name
* `msapplication-TileColor` - Windows tile color
* Favicons and icons from your config
* Sitemap reference link

Any meta tags in your `docs.json` `seo.metatags` configuration are also automatically injected into every page, such as `google-site-verification` for search console validation.

## Global meta tags

To set default meta tags for all pages, add the `metatags` field to your `docs.json`.

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "og:image": "link to your default meta tag image"
    }
}
```

### Set a canonical URL

If you're using a custom domain, set the `canonical` meta tag to ensure search engines index your preferred domain. A canonical URL tells search engines which version of your documentation is the primary one. This improves SEO when your documentation is accessible from multiple URLs and prevents issues with duplicate content.

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "canonical": "https://www.your-custom-domain-here.com"
    }
}
```

## Page-specific meta tags

To set page-specific meta tags, add them to a page's frontmatter.

The following meta tags are supported at the page level:

* `title` - Page title
* `description` - Page description appears below the title on the page and in some search engine results
* `keywords` - Comma-separated keywords
* `og:title` - Open Graph title for social sharing
* `og:description` - Open Graph description
* `og:image` - Open Graph image URL
* `og:url` - Open Graph URL
* `og:type` - Open Graph type like "article" or "website"
* `og:image:width` - Open Graph image width
* `og:image:height` - Open Graph image height
* `twitter:title` - Twitter card title
* `twitter:description` - Twitter card description
* `twitter:image` - Twitter card image
* `twitter:card` - Twitter card type like "summary" or "summary\_large\_image"
* `twitter:site` - Twitter site handle
* `twitter:image:width` - Twitter image width
* `twitter:image:height` - Twitter image height
* `noindex` - Set to `true` to prevent search engine indexing
* `robots` - Robots meta tag value

```mdx  theme={null}
---
title: "Your example page title"
description: "Page-specific description"
"og:image": "link to your meta tag image"
"og:title": "Social media title"
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
---
```

<Note>
  Meta tags with colons must be wrapped in quotes. The `keywords` field must be formatted as a YAML array.
</Note>

## Common meta tags reference

Below is a comprehensive list of meta tags you can add to your `docs.json`. These meta tags help improve your site's SEO, social sharing, and browser compatibility.

<Note>
  The `og:image` adds a background image that Mintlify automatically overlays with your logo, page title, and description when generating social media previews.
</Note>

You can preview how your meta tags will appear on different platforms using [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/).

## Sitemaps and robots.txt files

Mintlify automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file and a `robots.txt` file. You can view your sitemap by appending `/sitemap.xml` to your documentation site's URL.

Only pages included in your `docs.json` are included by default. To include hidden links, add `seo.indexing` to your `docs.json`:

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
}
```

### Custom sitemaps and robots.txt files

To add a custom `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt` file, create a `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt` file at the root of your project. Adding a custom file will override the automatically generated file of the same name. If you delete a custom file, the default file will be used again.

## Disabling indexing

If you want to stop a page from being indexed by search engines, you can include the following in the [frontmatter](/organize/pages) of your page:

```
---
noindex: true
---
```

You can also specify `noindex` for all pages in your docs by setting the `metatags.robots` field to `"noindex"` in your `docs.json`:

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
      "robots": "noindex"
    }
  }
```

# Hidden pages
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/hidden-pages

Hide pages from your navigation while keeping them accessible.

Hidden pages are removed from your site's navigation but remain publicly accessible to anyone who knows their URL.

Use hidden pages for content that you want to be accessible on your site or referenced as context for AI tools, but not discoverable through the navigation.

For content requiring strict access control, you must configure [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup).

If you want to hide pages for specific groups of users, use personalization to control [page visibility](/authentication-personalization/overview#page-visibility).

## Hiding a page

A page is hidden if it is not included in your `docs.json` navigation. To hide a page, remove it from your navigation structure.

Hidden pages use the same URL structure as regular pages based on their file path. For example,  `guides/hidden-page.mdx` would be accessible at `docs.yoursite.com/guides/hidden-page`.

See an [example of a hidden page](/organize/hidden-page-example).

<Note>
  Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.
</Note>

## Hiding a group of pages

A group of pages is hidden if the `hidden` property is set to `true` in your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4} theme={null}
"groups": [
  {
    "group": "Getting started",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  },
  {
    "group": "Guides",
    "pages": [
      "guides/hidden-page.mdx",
      "guides/hidden-groups.mdx"
    ]
  }
]
```

In this example, the `Getting started` group is hidden, but the `Guides` group is visible.

### Hiding a tab

You can also hide a tab by adding the `hidden` property to your `docs.json` file:

```json highlight={4} theme={null}
"tabs": [
  {
    "tab": "Home",
    "hidden": true,
    "pages": [
      "index",
      "quickstart"
    ]
  }
]
```

## Search, SEO, and AI indexing

By default, hidden pages are excluded from indexing for search engines, internal search within your docs, and as context for the AI assistant. To include hidden pages in search results and as context for the assistant, add the `seo` property to your `docs.json`:

```json  theme={null}
"seo": {
    "indexing": "all"
}
```

To exclude a specific page, add `noindex: true` to its frontmatter.


# Mintignore
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/mintignore

Exclude specific files and directories from your published documentation.

The `.mintignore` file allows you to exclude specific files and directories from being processed and published to your documentation site.

Use `.mintignore` to keep drafts, internal notes, and source files out of your public documentation while maintaining them in your repository.

## Create a .mintignore file

Create a `.mintignore` file in the root of your docs directory. This file uses the same pattern syntax as `.gitignore`.

```plaintext .mintignore theme={null}
# Exclude draft documents
drafts/
*.draft.mdx

# Exclude internal documentation
internal/

# Exclude specific files
private-notes.md
```

When Mintlify builds your documentation, it reads the `.mintignore` file and excludes any matching files or directories from processing.

Excluded files:

* Don't appear in your published documentation.
* Aren't indexed for search.
* Aren't accessible to visitors.
* Are ignored by [broken link checks](/installation#find-broken-links). Links that point to ignored files are broken.

## Default ignored patterns

Mintlify automatically ignores the following directories without requiring any configuration:

* `.git`
* `.github`
* `.claude`
* `.agents`
* `.idea`
* `node_modules`

You don't need to add these to your `.mintignore` file.

<Note>
  Unlike [hidden pages](/organize/hidden-pages), files excluded by `.mintignore`
  are completely removed from your site and cannot be accessed by URL.
</Note>

## Pattern syntax

The `.mintignore` file follows `.gitignore` syntax. Some common patterns include:

| Pattern            | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `drafts/`          | Excludes the entire `drafts` directory         |
| `*.draft.mdx`      | Excludes all files ending in `.draft.mdx`      |
| `private-notes.md` | Excludes a specific file                       |
| `**/internal/**`   | Excludes any `internal` directory at any level |
| `!important.mdx`   | Negates a previous pattern (includes the file) |


# Navigation
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/navigation

Design information architecture that aligns with user needs.

The [navigation](/organize/settings#param-navigation) property in `docs.json` controls the structure and information hierarchy of your documentation.

With proper navigation configuration, you can organize your content so that users can find exactly what they're looking for.

Choose one primary organizational pattern at the root level of your navigation. Once you've chosen your primary pattern, you can nest other navigation elements within it.

## Pages

Pages are the most fundamental navigation component. Each page is an MDX file in your documentation repository.

In the `navigation` object, `pages` is an array where each entry must reference the path to a [page file](/organize/pages).

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "pages": [
      "settings",
      "pages",
      "navigation",
      "themes",
      "custom-domain"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Groups

Use groups to organize your sidebar navigation into sections. Groups can be nested within each other, labeled with tags, and styled with icons.

In the `navigation` object, `groups` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `group` field and a `pages` field. The `icon`, `tag`, and `expanded` fields are optional.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Getting started",
        "icon": "play",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          {
            "group": "Editing",
            "expanded": false,
            "icon": "pencil",
            "pages": [
              "installation",
              "editor"
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Writing content",
        "icon": "notebook-text",
        "tag": "NEW",
        "pages": [
          "writing-content/page",
          "writing-content/text"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Default expanded state

Use the `expanded` property to control the default state of a nested group in the navigation sidebar.

* `expanded: true`: Group is expanded by default.
* `expanded: false` or omitted: Group is collapsed by default.

<Note>
  The `expanded` property only affects nested groups--groups within groups. Top-level groups are always expanded and cannot be collapsed.
</Note>

```json  theme={null}
{
  "group": "Getting started",
  "pages": [
    "quickstart",
    {
      "group": "Advanced",
      "expanded": false,
      "pages": ["installation", "configuration"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tabs

Tabs create distinct sections of your documentation with separate URL paths. Tabs create a horizontal navigation bar at the top of your documentation that lets users switch between sections.

In the `navigation` object, `tabs` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `tab` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "API reference",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "pages": [
          "api-reference/get",
          "api-reference/post",
          "api-reference/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "tab": "SDKs",
        "icon": "code",
        "pages": [
          "sdk/fetch",
          "sdk/create",
          "sdk/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "tab": "Blog",
        "icon": "newspaper",
        "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Menus

Menus add dropdown navigation items to a tab. Use menus to help users go directly to specific pages within a tab.

In the `navigation` object, `menu` is an array where each entry is an object that requires an `item` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

Menu items can only contain groups, pages, and external links.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "tabs": [
      {
        "tab": "Developer tools",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "menu": [
          {
            "item": "API reference",
            "icon": "rocket",
            "groups": [
              {
                "group": "Core endpoints",
                "icon": "square-terminal",
                "pages": [
                  "api-reference/get",
                  "api-reference/post",
                  "api-reference/delete"
                ]
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "item": "SDKs",
            "icon": "code",
            "description": "SDKs are used to interact with the API.",
            "pages": [
              "sdk/fetch",
              "sdk/create",
              "sdk/delete"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Anchors

Anchors add persistent navigation items to the top of your sidebar. Use anchors to section your content, provide quick access to external resources, or create prominent calls to action.

In the `navigation` object, `anchors` is an array where each entry is an object that requires an `anchor` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "anchors": [
      {
        "anchor": "Documentation",
        "icon": "book-open",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          "development",
          "navigation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "anchor": "API reference",
        "icon": "square-terminal",
        "pages": [
          "api-reference/get",
          "api-reference/post",
          "api-reference/delete"
        ]
      },
      {
        "anchor": "Blog",
        "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Global anchors

Use global anchors for external links that should appear on all pages, regardless of which section of your navigation the user is viewing. Global anchors are particularly useful for linking to resources outside your documentation, such as a blog, community forum, or support portal.

<Note>
  Global anchors must include an `href` field pointing to an external URL. They cannot contain relative paths.
</Note>

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "global":  {
      "anchors": [
        {
          "anchor": "Community",
          "icon": "house",
          "href": "https://slack.com"
        },
        {
          "anchor": "Blog",
          "icon": "pencil",
          "href": "https://mintlify.com/blog"
        }
      ]
    },
    "tabs": /*...*/
  }
}
```

## Dropdowns

Dropdowns are contained in an expandable menu at the top of your sidebar navigation. Each item in a dropdown directs to a section of your documentation.

Products create a dedicated navigation division for organizing product-specific documentation. Use products to separate different offerings, services, or major feature sets within your documentation.

In the `navigation` object, `products` is an array where each entry is an object that requires a `product` field and can contain other navigation fields such as groups, pages, icons, or links to external pages.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "products": [
      {
        "product": "Core API",
        "description": "Core API description",
        "icon": "api",

        ]
      },

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## OpenAPI

Integrate OpenAPI specifications directly into your navigation structure to automatically generate API documentation. Create dedicated API sections or place endpoint pages within other navigation components.

Set a default OpenAPI specification at any level of your navigation hierarchy. Child elements will inherit this specification unless they define their own specification.

<Note>
  When you add the `openapi` property to a navigation element (such as an anchor, tab, or group) without specifying any pages, Mintlify automatically generates pages for **all endpoints** defined in your OpenAPI specification.

  To control which endpoints appear, explicitly list the desired endpoints in a `pages` array.
</Note>

For more information about referencing OpenAPI endpoints in your docs, see the [OpenAPI setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup).

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "API reference",
        "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v1.json",
        "pages": [
          "overview",
          "authentication",
          "GET /users",
          "POST /users",
          {
            "group": "Products",
            "openapi": "/path/to/openapi-v2.json",
            "pages": [
              "GET /products",
              "POST /products"
            ]
          }

## Nesting

Navigation elements can be nested within each other to create complex hierarchies. You must have one root-level parent navigation element such as tabs, groups, or a dropdown. You can nest other types of navigation elements within your primary navigation pattern.

Each navigation element can contain one type of child element at each level of your navigation hierarchy. For example, a tab can contain anchors that contain groups, but a tab cannot contain both anchors and groups at the same level.

              "pages": ["v2/api/overview", "v2/api/endpoints"]
            }
          ]
        },

                  "pages": ["v1/quickstart"]

        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs display the full navigation path at the top of pages. Some themes have breadcrumbs enabled by default and others do not. You can control whether breadcrumbs are enabled for your site using the `styling` property in your `docs.json`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Display full breadcrumbs theme={null}
  "styling": {
    "eyebrows": "breadcrumbs"
  }
  ```

  ```json Display parent section only theme={null}
  "styling": {
    "eyebrows": "section"
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Interaction configuration

Control how users interact with navigation elements using the `interaction` property in your `docs.json`.

### Enable auto-navigation for groups

When a user expands a navigation group, some themes will automatically navigate to the first page in the group. You can override a theme's default behavior using the `drilldown` option.

* Set to `true` to force automatic navigation to the first page when a navigation group is selected.
* Set to `false` to prevent navigation and only expand or collapse the group when it is selected.
* Leave unset to use the theme's default behavior.

<CodeGroup>
  ```json Force navigation theme={null}
  "interaction": {
    "drilldown": true  // Force navigation to first page when a user expands a dropdown
  }
  ```

  ```json Prevent navigation theme={null}
  "interaction": {
    "drilldown": false // Never navigate, only expand or collapse the group
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Pages
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/pages

Configure page metadata, titles, and frontmatter properties.

Each page is a Markdown file. Both `.mdx` and `.md` file types are supported. We recommend using MDX, which combines Markdown with React components to create rich, interactive documentation. Plain Markdown (`.md`) is supported for easier migration from other platforms, but should be updated to MDX for full functionality.

## Page metadata

Every page starts with frontmatter, the YAML metadata enclosed by `---` at the beginning of a file. This metadata defines how your page appears and behaves.

Use frontmatter to control:

* Page titles and descriptions
* Sidebar titles, icons, and tags
* Page layouts
* SEO meta tags
* Custom metadata

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  The title of your page that appears in navigation and browser tabs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief description of what this page covers. Appears under the title and improves SEO.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sidebarTitle" type="string">
  A short title that displays in the sidebar navigation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="icon" type="string">
  The icon to display.

  Options:

  * [Font Awesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons) name
  * [Lucide icon](https://lucide.dev/icons) name
  * URL to an externally hosted icon
  * Path to an icon file in your project
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="iconType" type="string">
  The [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icon style. Only used with Font Awesome icons.

  Options: `regular`, `solid`, `light`, `thin`, `sharp-solid`, `duotone`, `brands`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
  A tag that appears next to your page title in the sidebar.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="<custom>" type="string">
  Any valid YAML frontmatter. For example, `product: "API"` or `version: "1.0.0"`.
</ResponseField>

```yaml Example YAML frontmatter wrap theme={null}
---
title: "About frontmatter"
description: "Frontmatter is the metadata that controls how your page appears and behaves"
sidebarTitle: "Frontmatter"
icon: "book"
tag: "NEW"
---
```

## Page mode

Control how your page displays with the `mode` setting.

### Default

If no mode is defined, defaults to a standard layout with a sidebar navigation and table of contents.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "Default page title"
---
```

### Wide

Wide mode hides the table of contents. This is useful for pages that do not have any headings or if you prefer to use the extra horizontal space. Wide mode is available for all themes.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "Wide page title"
mode: "wide"
---
```

### Custom

Custom mode provides a minimalist layout that removes all elements except for the top navbar. Custom mode is a blank canvas to create landing pages or any other unique layouts that you want to have minimal navigation elements for. Custom mode is available for all themes.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "Custom page title"
mode: "custom"
---
```

### Frame

Frame mode provides a layout similar to custom mode, but preserves the sidebar navigation. This page mode allows for custom HTML and components while maintaining the default navigation experience. Frame mode is only available for Aspen and Almond themes.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "Frame page title"
mode: "frame"
---
```

### Center

Center mode removes the sidebar and table of contents, centering the content. This is useful for changelogs or other pages where you want to emphasize the content. Center mode is available for Mint and Linden themes.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "Center page title"
mode: "center"
---
```

## API pages

Create interactive API playgrounds by adding an API specification to your frontmatter, `api` or `openapi`.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
openapi: "GET /endpoint"
---
```

Learn more about building [API documentation](/api-playground/overview).

## External links

Link to external sites directly from your navigation with the `url` metadata.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
title: "npm Package"
url: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint"
---
```

## Search engine optimization

Most SEO meta tags are automatically generated. You can set SEO meta tags manually to improve your site's SEO, social sharing, and browser compatibility.

<Note>
  Meta tags with colons must be wrapped in quotes.
</Note>

```yaml  theme={null}
---
"twitter:image": "/images/social-preview.jpg"
---
```

See [SEO](/optimize/seo) for complete SEO metadata options.

## Internal search keywords

Enhance a specific page's discoverability in the built-in search by providing `keywords` in your metadata. These keywords won't appear as part of the page content or in search results, but users that search for them will be shown the page as a result.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
keywords: ['configuration', 'setup', 'getting started']
---
```


# Global settings
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/organize/settings

Configure site-wide settings in docs.json.

The `docs.json` file lets you turn a collection of Markdown files into a navigable, customized documentation site. This required configuration file controls styling, navigation, integrations, and more. Think of it as the blueprint for your documentation.

Settings in `docs.json` apply globally to all pages.

## Setting up your `docs.json`

To get started, you only need to specify `theme`, `name`, `colors.primary`, and `navigation`. Other fields are optional and you can add them as your documentation needs grow.

For the best editing experience, include the schema reference at the top of your `docs.json` file. This enables autocomplete, validation, and helpful tooltips in most code editors:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "$schema": "https://mintlify.com/docs.json",
  "theme": "mint",
  "name": "Your Docs",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#ff0000"
  },
  "navigation": {
    // Your navigation structure
  }
  // The rest of your configuration
}
```

## Reference

This section contains the full reference for the `docs.json` file.

## Upgrading from `mint.json`

If your docs project uses the deprecated `mint.json` file, follow these steps to upgrade to `docs.json`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install or update the CLI">
    If you haven't installed the [CLI](/installation), install it now:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash npm theme={null}
      npm i -g mint
      ```

      ```bash yarn theme={null}
      yarn global add mint
      ```

      ```bash pnpm theme={null}
      pnpm add -g mint
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    If you already have the CLI installed, make sure it is up to date:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mint update
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your docs.json file">
    In your docs repository, run:

    ```bash  theme={null}
    mint upgrade
    ```

    This command will create a `docs.json` file from your existing `mint.json`. Review the generated file to ensure all settings are correct.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete your mint.json file">
    After verifying your `docs.json` is configured properly, you can safely delete your old `mint.json` file.
  </Step>
</Steps>


# Quickstart

<Info>
  Update the GitHub App permissions if you move your documentation to a different repository.
</Info>

### Authorize your GitHub account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **My Profile** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Authorize GitHub account**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub authorization page.

<Info>
  An admin for your GitHub organization may need to authorize your account depending on your organization settings.
</Info>

## Editing workflows

Mintlify offers two workflows for creating and maintaining your documentation:

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  For users who prefer working with existing tools in their local environment. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  For users who prefer a visual interface in their web browser. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

## Code-based workflow

The code-based workflow integrates with your existing development environment and Git repositories. This workflow is best for technical teams who want to manage documentation alongside code.

### Install the CLI

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: The CLI requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.17.0 or higher through v24. LTS versions are preferred.
</Info>

To work locally with your documentation, install the Command Line Interface (CLI), called [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint), by running this command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm theme={null}
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm theme={null}
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Create a new project

Run `mint new` to create a new documentation project. See the [CLI installation guide](/installation#create-a-new-project) for details on the command and flags.

### Edit the documentation

After setting up your project, you can start editing your documentation files. For example, update the title of the introduction page:

1. Navigate to your documentation repository.
2. Open `index.mdx` and locate the top of the file:

```mdx index.mdx theme={null}
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

3. Update the `title` field to `"Hello World"`.

```mdx index.mdx {2} theme={null}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview the changes

To preview the changes locally, run the following command:

```bash  theme={null}
mint dev
```

Your preview is available at `localhost:3000`.

## Web editor workflow

The web editor workflow provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface for creating and editing documentation. This workflow is best for people who want to work in their web browser without additional local development tools.

### Access the web editor

1. Log in to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

<Info>
  If you have not installed the GitHub App, you will be prompted to install the app when you open the web editor.

<Tip>
  The editor provides a rich set of formatting tools and components. Type <kbd>/</kbd>

  in the editor to open the command menu and access these tools.
</Tip>

### Publish your changes

When you're satisfied with your edits, select the **Publish** button in the top-right corner. Your changes are immediately deployed to your documentation site.

<Tip>
  Use branches to preview and review changes through pull requests before deploying to your live site.
</Tip>

For more details about using the web editor, including using branches and pull requests to collaborate and preview changes, see our [web editor documentation](/editor).

## Adding a custom domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

## Integration with `useChat`

The `useChat` hook from Vercel's AI SDK is the recommended way to integrate the assistant API into your application.

<Note>
  The Mintlify assistant API is compatible with **AI SDK v4**. If you use AI SDK v5 or later, you must configure a custom transport.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install AI SDK v4">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm i ai@^4.1.15
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the hook">
    ```tsx  theme={null}
    import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

    function MyComponent({ domain }) {
      const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } = useChat({
        api: `https://api-dsc.mintlify.com/v1/assistant/${domain}/message`,
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.MINTLIFY_TOKEN}`,
        },
        body: {
          fp: 'anonymous',
          retrievalPageSize: 5,
        },
        streamProtocol: 'data',
        sendExtraMessageFields: true,
      });

      return (
        <div>
          {messages.map((message) => (
            <div key={message.id}>
              {message.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'Assistant: '}
              {message.content}
            </div>
          ))}
          <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} />
            <button type="submit">Send</button>
          </form>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

    **Required configuration for Mintlify:**

    * `streamProtocol: 'data'` - Required for streaming responses.
    * `sendExtraMessageFields: true` - Required to send message metadata.
    * `body.fp` - Fingerprint identifier (use 'anonymous' or a user identifier).
    * `body.retrievalPageSize` - Number of search results to use (recommended: 5).
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Accessibility
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/accessibility

Create documentation that as many people as possible can use with WCAG compliance.

When you create accessible documentation, you prioritize content design that makes your documentation usable by as many people as possible regardless of how they access and interact with your documentation.

Accessible documentation improves the user experience for everyone. Your content is more clear, better structured, and easier to navigate.

This guide offers some best practices for creating accessible documentation, but it is not exhaustive. You should consider accessibility an ongoing process. Technologies and standards change over time, which introduce new opportunities to improve documentation.

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility (sometimes abbreviated as a11y for the number of letters between the first and last letters of "accessibility") is intentionally designing and building websites and tools that as many people as possible can use. People with temporary or permanent disabilities should have the same level of access to digital technologies. And designing for accessibility benefits everyone, including people who access your website on mobile devices or slow networks.

Accessible documentation follows web accessibility standards, primarily the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). These guidelines help ensure your content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

## Getting started with accessibility

Making your documentation accessible is a process. You don't have to fix everything all at once and you can't do it only once.

If you're just beginning to implement accessibility practices for your documentation, consider a phased approach where you start with high-impact changes and build from there.

### First steps

Here are three things you can do right now to improve the accessibility of your documentation:

1. **Run `mint a11y`** to identify accessibility issues in your content.
2. **Add alt text** to all images.
3. **Check your heading hierarchy** to ensure one H1 per page and headings follow sequential order.

### Plan your accessibility work

The best workflow is the one that works for your team. Here is one way that you can approach accessibility work:

**Phase 1: Images and structure**

* Review all images for descriptive alt text.
* Audit link text and replace generic phrases like "click here."
* Fix heading hierarchy issues across your documentation.

**Phase 2: Navigation and media**

* Test keyboard navigation on your documentation.
* Test screen reader support.
* Add captions and transcripts to embedded videos.
* Review color contrast.

**Phase 3: Build it into your workflow**

* Run `mint a11y` before publishing new content.
* Include accessibility checks in your content review process.
* Test keyboard navigation when adding interactive features.
* Verify new external links and embeds include proper titles and descriptions.

Starting small and building accessibility into your regular workflow makes it sustainable. Each improvement helps more users access your documentation successfully.

## Structure your content

Well-structured content is easier to navigate and understand, especially for screen reader users who rely on headings to move through pages and people who use keyboard navigation.

### Use proper heading hierarchy

Each page should have a single H1 heading, which is defined by the `title:` property in a page's frontmatter. Use additional headings in order without skipping. For example, don't skip from H2 to H4.

```mdx  theme={null}
<!-- Good -->
# Page title (H1)

## Main section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

### Another subsection (H3)

## Another main section (H2)

<!-- Bad -->
# Page title (H1)

## Main section (H2)

#### Subsection (H4)

### Another subsection (H3)
```

Headings at the same level should have unique names.

```mdx  theme={null}
<!-- Good -->
## Accessibility tips (H2)

### Write effective alt text (H3)

### Use proper color contrast (H3)

<!-- Bad -->
## Accessibility tips (H2)

### Tip (H3)

### Tip (H3)
```

### Write descriptive link text

Link text should be meaningful and connected to the destination. Avoid vague phrases like "click here" or "read more."

```mdx  theme={null}
<!-- Good -->
Learn how to [configure your navigation](/organize/navigation).

<!-- Unclear relation between  -->
[Learn more](/organize/navigation).
```

### Keep content scannable

* Break up long paragraphs.
* Use lists for steps and options.
* Highlight information with callouts.

### Use proper table structure

Use tables sparingly and only for tabular data that has meaning inherited from the column and row headers.

When using tables, include headers so screen readers can associate data with the correct column:

```mdx  theme={null}
| Feature | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Search  | Active |
| Analytics | Active |
```

## Write descriptive alt text

Alt text makes images accessible to screen reader users and appears when images fail to load. Images in your documentation should have alt text that describes the image and makes it clear why the image is included. Even with alt text, you should not rely on images alone to convey information. Make sure your content describes what the image communicates.

### Write effective alt text

* **Be specific**: Describe what the image shows, not just that it's an image.
* **Be concise**: Aim for one to two sentences.
* **Avoid redundancy**: Don't start with "Image of" because screen readers will already know that the alt text is associated with an image. However, you should include descriptions like "Screenshot of" or "Diagram of" if that context is important to the image.

```mdx  theme={null}
<!-- Good -->
![Screenshot of the dashboard showing three active projects and two pending invitations](/images/dashboard.png)

<!-- Not helpful -->
![Dashboard screenshot](/images/dashboard.png)
```

### Add alt text to images

For Markdown images, include alt text in the square brackets:

```mdx  theme={null}
![Description of the image](/path/to/image.png)
```

For HTML images, use the `alt` attribute:

```html  theme={null}
<img
  src="/images/screenshot.png"
  alt="Settings panel with accessibility options enabled. The options are emphasized with an orange rectangle."
/>
```

### Add titles to embedded content

Iframes and video embeds require descriptive titles:

```html  theme={null}
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Setting up your first documentation site"
></iframe>
```

## Design for readability

Visual design choices affect how accessible your documentation is to users with low vision, color blindness, or other visual disabilities.

### Ensure sufficient color contrast

If you customize your theme colors, verify the contrast ratios meet WCAG requirements:

* Body text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
* Large text: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
* Interactive elements: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

Test both light and dark mode. The `mint a11y` command checks for color contrast.

### Don't rely on color alone

If you use color to convey information, include a text label or icon as well. For example, don't mark errors only with red text. Include an error icon or the word "Error."

### Use clear, concise language

* Write in plain language.
* Define technical terms when first used.
* Avoid run-on sentences.
* Use active voice.

## Make code examples accessible

Code blocks are a core part of technical documentation, but they require specific accessibility considerations to ensure screen reader users can understand them. In general, follow these guidelines:

* Break long code examples into smaller, logical chunks.
* Comment complex logic within the code.
* Consider providing a text description for complex algorithms.
* When showing file structure, use actual code blocks with language labels rather than ASCII art.

### Specify the programming language

Always declare the language for syntax highlighting. This helps screen readers announce the code context to users:

````mdx  theme={null}
```javascript
function getUserData(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```
````

### Provide context around code

Provide clear context for code blocks:

````mdx  theme={null}
The following function fetches user data from the API:

```javascript
function getUserData(id) {
  return fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
}
```

This returns a promise that resolves to the user object.
````

## Video and multimedia accessibility

Videos, animations, and other multimedia content need text alternatives so all users can access the information they contain.

### Add captions to videos

Captions make video content accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing. They also help users in sound-sensitive environments and non-native speakers:

* Use captions for all spoken content in videos.
* Include relevant sound effects in captions.
* Ensure captions are synchronized with the audio.
* Use proper punctuation and speaker identification when multiple people speak.

Most video hosting platforms support adding captions. Upload caption files or use auto-generated captions as a starting point, then review for accuracy.

### Provide transcripts

Transcripts offer an alternative way to access video content. They're searchable, easier to reference, and accessible to screen readers:

```mdx  theme={null}
<iframe
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/example"
  title="Tutorial: Setting up authentication"
></iframe>

<Accordion title="Video transcript">
In this tutorial, we'll walk through setting up authentication...
</Accordion>
```

Place transcripts near the video or provide a clear link to access them.

### Consider alternatives to video-only content

If critical information only appears in a video:

* Provide the same information in text form.
* Include key screenshots with descriptive alt text.
* Create a written tutorial that covers the same material.

This ensures users who can't access video content can still complete their task.

## Test your documentation

Regular testing helps you catch accessibility issues before users encounter them.

### Check for accessibility issues with `mint a11y`

Use the `mint a11y` CLI command to automatically scan your documentation for common accessibility issues:

```bash  theme={null}
mint a11y
```

The command checks for:

* Missing alt text on images
* Improper heading hierarchy
* Insufficient color contrast

When the scan completes, review the reported issues and fix them in your content. Run the command again to verify your fixes.

### Basic keyboard navigation test

Navigate through your documentation using only your keyboard:

1. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move forward through interactive elements.
2. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> to move backward.
3. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to activate links and buttons.
4. Verify all interactive elements are reachable and have visible focus indicators.

### Go deeper with accessibility testing

For more comprehensive testing:

* **Screen readers**: Test with [NVDA (Windows)](https://www.nvaccess.org/) or [VoiceOver (Mac)](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/).
* **Browser extensions**: Install [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) or [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) to scan pages for issues.
* **WCAG guidelines**: Review the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) for detailed standards.

    Create a `.env` file in the project root:

    ```bash .env theme={null}
    VITE_MINTLIFY_TOKEN=mint_dsc_your_token_here
    ```

    Replace `mint_dsc_your_token_here` with your assistant API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your application in a browser and click the **Ask** button to open the assistant widget.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project structure

The example uses a component-based architecture.

```text  theme={null}
src/
├── App.css                 # App styles
├── App.jsx                 # Main app component that renders the widget
├── config.js               # Configuration (domain and docsURL)
├── index.css               # Global styles
├── main.jsx                # Entry point
├── utils.js                # Helper functions for parsing suggestions and extracting sources
└── components/
    ├── AssistantWidget.jsx # Main widget component with chat state and API logic
    └── Message.jsx         # Individual message component for rendering user and assistant messages
```

**Key files:**

* **`src/App.jsx`**: Main app component. Shows how to import and use the `AssistantWidget` component.
* **`src/config.js`**: Centralized configuration. Update this file with your domain and docs URL.
* **`src/components/AssistantWidget.jsx`**: The main widget component. Manages the open/close state, chat messages, and API calls.
* **`src/utils.js`**: Contains utility functions for parsing the assistant's response format and extracting sources.
* **`src/components/Message.jsx`**: Renders individual messages with support for Markdown and suggestion links.

## Customization ideas

### Source citations

Extract and display sources from assistant responses:

```jsx  theme={null}
const extractSources = (parts) => {
  return parts
    ?.filter(p => p.type === 'tool-invocation' && p.toolInvocation?.toolName === 'search')
    .flatMap(p => p.toolInvocation?.result || [])
    .map(source => ({
      url: source.url || source.path,
      title: source.metadata?.title || source.path,
    })) || [];
};

// In your message rendering:
{messages.map((message) => {
  const sources = message.role === 'assistant' ? extractSources(message.parts) : [];
  return (
    <div key={message.id}>
      {/* message content */}
      {sources.length > 0 && (
        <div className="mt-2 text-xs">
          <p className="font-semibold">Sources:</p>
          {sources.map((s, i) => (
            <a key={i} href={s.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-600">
              {s.title}
            </a>
          ))}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
})}
```

### Track conversation thread IDs

Store thread IDs to maintain conversation history across sessions:

```jsx  theme={null}
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function AssistantWidget({ domain, docsURL }) {
  const [threadId, setThreadId] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Retrieve saved thread ID from localStorage
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('assistant-thread-id');
    if (saved) {
      setThreadId(saved);
    }
  }, []);

  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading } = useChat({
    api: `https://api-dsc.mintlify.com/v1/assistant/${domain}/message`,
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_MINTLIFY_TOKEN}`,
    },
    body: {
      fp: 'anonymous',
      retrievalPageSize: 5,
      ...(threadId && { threadId }), // Include thread ID if available
    },
    streamProtocol: 'data',
    sendExtraMessageFields: true,
    fetch: async (url, options) => {
      const response = await fetch(url, options);
      const newThreadId = response.headers.get('x-thread-id');
      if (newThreadId) {
        setThreadId(newThreadId);
        localStorage.setItem('assistant-thread-id', newThreadId);
      }
      return response;
    },
  });

  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Add keyboard shortcuts

Allow users to open the widget and submit messages with keyboard shortcuts:

```jsx  theme={null}
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e) => {
    // Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + I to toggle widget
    if ((e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey) && e.shiftKey && e.key === 'I') {
      e.preventDefault();
      setIsOpen((prev) => !prev);
    }

    // Enter (when widget is focused) to submit
    if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey && document.activeElement.id === 'assistant-input') {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleSubmit();
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [handleSubmit]);
```


# Tutorial: Auto-update documentation when code is changed
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/automate-agent

Use the agent API to automatically update your documentation.

## What you will build

An automation that updates your documentation when code is pushed to your main branch. The workflow can be built on multiple platforms, including GitHub Actions and n8n. It watches your code repository and then calls the agent API to update your documentation in a separate documentation repository.

This workflow connects two separate repositories:

* **Code repository**: Where you store application code. You'll set up the automation trigger on this repository. Examples include a backend API, frontend app, SDK, or CLI tool.
* **Documentation repository**: Where you store your documentation and connect to your Mintlify project. The agent creates pull requests with documentation updates in this repository.

This tutorial assumes your documentation is in a separate repository from your application code. If you have a monorepo, modify the workflow to target the directory where you store your documentation.

### Workflow overview

1. Someone pushes code to your main branch.
2. The workflow triggers.
3. The workflow calls the agent API to update your documentation.
4. The agent creates a pull request with documentation updates in your documentation repository.

## Choose your platform

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GitHub Actions">
    GitHub Actions is the simplest option if your code is already on GitHub. No additional services required.

    ## Prerequisites

    * GitHub Actions enabled on your code and documentation repositories
    * [Mintlify GitHub App](/deploy/github) installed in both your code and documentation repositories
    * [Mintlify admin API key](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
    * [Mintlify project ID](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
    * [Mintlify Pro or Custom plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
    * Admin access to the GitHub repositories for your code and documentation

    ### Install the Mintlify app on your code repository

    The Mintlify app must be installed on your code repository so the agent can fetch context from your codebase. To add the app to new repositories:

    1. Open the agent panel in your Mintlify dashboard.

    2. Select **Create Admin API Key**.
    3. Copy the key and save it securely.

    ## Build the workflow

    ### Create the workflow file

    1. In your code repository, create a new file: `.github/workflows/update-docs.yml`
    2. Add this workflow:

       ```yaml  theme={null}
       name: Update Docs

       on:
       push:
           branches:
           - main

       jobs:
       update-docs:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
           steps:
           - uses: actions/github-script@v8
               env:
               MINTLIFY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.MINTLIFY_API_KEY }}
               PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.MINTLIFY_PROJECT_ID }}
               with:
               script: |
                   const { owner, repo } = context.repo;
                   const projectId = process.env.PROJECT_ID;
                   const apiKey = process.env.MINTLIFY_API_KEY;

                   if (!projectId || !apiKey) {
                   core.setFailed('Missing MINTLIFY_PROJECT_ID or MINTLIFY_API_KEY secrets');
                   return;
                   }

                   const url = `https://api.mintlify.com/v1/agent/${projectId}/job`;
                   const payload = {
                   branch: `mintlify/docs-update-${Date.now()}`,
                   messages: [
                       {
                       role: 'system',
                       content: 'You are an action runner that updates documentation based on code changes. You should never ask questions. If you are not able to access the repository, report the error and exit.'

                       {
                       role: 'user',
                       content: `Update the documentation for our recent pushes to main:\n\nRepository: ${owner}/${repo}`
                       }
                   ]
                   };

                   try {
                       const response = await fetch(url, {
                       method: 'POST',
                       headers: {
                           'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
                           'Content-Type': 'application/json'
                       },
                       body: JSON.stringify(payload)
                       });

                       if (!response.ok) {
                       throw new Error(`API request failed with status ${response.status}: ${await response.text()}`);
                       }

                       const reader = response.body.getReader();
                       const decoder = new TextDecoder();
                       let buffer = '';

                       while (true) {
                       const { done, value } = await reader.read();
                       if (done) break;
                       buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
                       const lines = buffer.split('\n');
                       buffer = lines.pop() || '';
                       for (const line of lines) {
                           if (line.trim()) {
                           console.log(line);
                           }
                       }
                       }
                       if (buffer.trim()) {
                       console.log(buffer);
                       }

                       core.notice(`Documentation update job triggered for ${owner}/${repo}`);
                   } catch (error) {
                       core.setFailed(`Failed to create documentation update job: ${error.message}`);
                   }
       ```

    ### Add secrets

    1. In your code repository, go to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**.
    2. Click **New repository secret**.
    3. Add the following secrets:
       * Name: `MINTLIFY_API_KEY`, Secret: Your Mintlify admin API key
       * Name: `MINTLIFY_PROJECT_ID`, Secret: Your Mintlify project ID (found on the [API keys](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys) page of your dashboard)

    For more information, see [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) in the GitHub documentation.

    ## Test the automation

    1. Make a small change in your code repository and push to main:
       ```bash  theme={null}
       git add .
       git commit -m "Test: trigger docs automation"
       git push origin main
       ```

    2. Check the **Actions** tab in your code repository to see the workflow running.

    3. After the workflow runs, check your documentation repository for a new branch and pull request with documentation updates.

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Workflow not running

    * Verify GitHub Actions is enabled in your code repository.
    * Check the **Actions** tab for error messages.
    * Ensure the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` with a `.yml` extension.

    ### 401 error from agent API

    if (webhookData.ref !== "refs/heads/main") {
      return [];
    }

    // Extract information
    const repository = webhookData.repository;
    const pusher = webhookData.pusher;

    // Build message for agent
    const agentMessage = `Update documentation for changes pushed to main in ${repository.name}. Always edit files and create a pull request.`;

    return {
      json: {
        codeRepoName: repository.full_name,
        codeRepoShortName: repository.name,
        agentMessage: agentMessage
      }

    This code stops the workflow if the push wasn't to main, extracts all relevant information from the GitHub webhook, and creates a message for the agent API.

    ### Call the agent API

    Add an HTTP request node to create a documentation job.

    1. Add an HTTP request node.
    2. Name it "Create agent job."
    3. Configure the request:

       * Method: `POST`
       * URL: `https://api.mintlify.com/v1/agent/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/job` (replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your project ID from the [API keys](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys) page)
       * Authentication: Generic Credential Type → Header Auth
         * Create a new credential:
           * Name: `Authorization`
           * Value: `Bearer mint_YOUR_API_KEY` (replace with your API key)
       * Send Body: On
       * Body Content Type: JSON
       * Specify Body: Using JSON
       * Add this JSON:

       ```json  theme={null}
       {
       "branch": "docs-update-from-{{ $json.codeRepoShortName }}-{{ $now.toISOString() }}",
       "messages": [
           {
           "role": "system",
           "content": "{{ $json.agentMessage }}"

    ## Test the automation

    1. Create a test branch in your code repository:
       ```bash  theme={null}
       git checkout -b test-docs-automation
       ```

    2. Make a small change and commit it:
       ```bash  theme={null}
       git add .
       git commit -m "Test: trigger docs automation"
       git push origin test-docs-automation
       ```

    3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

    4. Merge the pull request.

    ### Verify the automation

    You should see a new n8n execution with all nodes completed successfully, and a new branch and pull request in your documentation repository.

    ## Troubleshooting

    ### Webhook not triggering

    * Verify the workflow is active in n8n.
    * Check GitHub repository Settings → Webhooks → Recent Deliveries for the response code.
    * Confirm the webhook URL matches your n8n webhook URL exactly.

    ### 401 error from agent API

    * Verify your API key starts with `mint_`.
    * Check the Authorization header is formatted as `Bearer mint_yourkey`.
    * Confirm the API key is for the correct Mintlify organization.

    ### 401 error from GitHub

    * Verify your token has the `repo` scope.
    * Check that the token hasn't expired.
    * Confirm you included the `User-Agent` header in the GitHub request.

# Working with branches
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/branches

Create branches to preview changes and collaborate before publishing.

Branches are a feature of version control that point to specific commits in your repository. Your deployment branch, usually called `main`, represents the content that is used to build your live documentation. All other branches are independent of your live docs unless you choose to merge them into your deployment branch.

Branches let you create separate instances of your documentation to make changes, get reviews, and try new approaches before publishing. Your team can work on branches to update different parts of your documentation at the same time without affecting what users see on your live site until you publish any changes.

We recommend always working from branches when updating documentation to keep your live site stable and enable review workflows.

<Tip>
  * Name branches clearly so teammates understand what you're working on.
  * Delete branches after merging to keep your repository organized.
  * Let your team know when you're working on major changes that might affect their work.
</Tip>

## Creating a branch

1. Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main` by default).
2. Select **New Branch**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your branch like `update-getting-started` or `fix-api-examples`.
4. Select **Create Branch**.

## Saving changes on a branch

To save your changes on a branch, select the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner of the editor. This creates a commit and pushes your work to your branch.

## Switching branches

1. Select the branch name in the editor toolbar.
2. Select the branch you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.

<Tip>
  Unsaved changes are lost when switching branches. Make sure to save or publish your work before switching branches.
</Tip>


# Claude Code
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/claude-code

Configure Claude Code to write, review, and update your documentation.

Claude Code is an agentic command line tool that can help you maintain your documentation. It can write new content, review existing pages, and keep docs up to date.

You can train Claude Code to understand your documentation standards and workflows by adding a `CLAUDE.md` file to your project and refining it over time.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:**

* Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)

**Setup:**

1. Install Claude Code:

```bash  theme={null}
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your docs directory.
3. (Optional) Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project.
4. Run `claude` to start.

## CLAUDE.md template

Save a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your docs directory to help Claude Code understand your project. This file trains Claude Code on your documentation standards, preferences, and workflows. See [Manage Claude's memory](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) in the Anthropic docs for more information.

Copy this example template or make changes for your docs specifications:

```mdx  theme={null}
# Mintlify documentation

## Working relationship
- You can push back on ideas-this can lead to better documentation. Cite sources and explain your reasoning when you do so
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- NEVER lie, guess, or make up anything

## Project context
- Format: MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Config: docs.json for navigation, theme, settings
- Components: Mintlify components

## Content strategy
- Document just enough for user success - not too much, not too little
- Prioritize accuracy and usability
- Make content evergreen when possible
- Search for existing content before adding anything new. Avoid duplication unless it is done for a strategic reason
- Check existing patterns for consistency
- Start by making the smallest reasonable changes

## docs.json

- Refer to the [docs.json schema](https://mintlify.com/docs.json) when building the docs.json file and site navigation

## Frontmatter requirements for pages
- title: Clear, descriptive page title
- description: Concise summary for SEO/navigation

## Writing standards
- Second-person voice ("you")
- Prerequisites at start of procedural content
- Test all code examples before publishing
- Match style and formatting of existing pages
- Include both basic and advanced use cases
- Language tags on all code blocks
- Alt text on all images
- Relative paths for internal links

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask how to handle uncommitted changes before starting
- Create a new branch when no clear branch exists for changes
- Commit frequently throughout development
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks

## Do not
- Skip frontmatter on any MDX file
- Use absolute URLs for internal links
- Include untested code examples
- Make assumptions - always ask for clarification
```

## Sample prompts

Once you have Claude Code set up, try these prompts to see how it can help with common documentation tasks. You can copy and paste these examples directly, or adapt them for your specific needs.

### Convert notes to polished docs

Turn rough drafts into proper Markdown pages with components and frontmatter.

**Example prompt:**

```text wrap theme={null}
Convert this text into a properly formatted MDX page: [paste your text here]
```

### Review docs for consistency

Get suggestions to improve style, formatting, and component usage.

**Example prompt:**

```text wrap theme={null}
Review the files in docs/ and suggest improvements for consistency and clarity
```

### Update docs when features change

Keep documentation current when your product evolves.

**Example prompt:**

```text wrap theme={null}
Our API now requires a version parameter. Update our docs to include version=2024-01 in all examples
```

### Generate comprehensive code examples

Create multi-language examples with error handling.

**Example prompt:**

```text wrap theme={null}
Create code examples for [your API endpoint] in JavaScript, Python, and cURL with error handling
```

## Extending Claude Code

Beyond manually prompting Claude Code, you can integrate it with your existing workflows.

### Automation with GitHub Actions

Run Claude Code automatically when code changes to keep docs up to date. You can trigger documentation reviews on pull requests or update examples when API changes are detected.

### Multi-instance workflows

Use separate Claude Code sessions for different tasks - one for writing new content and another for reviewing and quality assurance. This helps maintain consistency and catch issues that a single session might miss.

### Team collaboration

Share your refined `CLAUDE.md` file with your team to ensure consistent documentation standards across all contributors. Teams often develop project-specific prompts and workflows that become part of their documentation process.

### Custom commands

Create reusable slash commands in `.claude/commands/` for frequently used documentation tasks specific to your project or team.


# Content types
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/content-types

Choose the right content type for your documentation goals.

<Tip>
  This page explains different content types, when to use each one, and how to approach writing for each type.
</Tip>

Documentation should be organized around the specific goal you're trying to help people achieve.

## Categorize using the Diátaxis framework

The [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr) is a helpful guide for categorizing content based on your audience's needs. Documentation can generally be mapped into one of these types:

1. Tutorials: Learning-oriented content for new users
2. How-to guides: Task-oriented guidance for specific problems
3. Explanations: Understanding-oriented conceptual discussions
4. Reference: Information-oriented technical descriptions

Defining content types helps you plan documentation with a clear purpose and makes it easier for users to find what they need.

## Picking a type

| Question                               | Tutorial               | How-To                   | Reference                | Explanation             |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------- |
| What is the user's goal?               | Learn through practice | Solve a specific problem | Find precise information | Understand concepts     |
| What is the user's knowledge?          | Beginner               | Intermediate             | Experienced              | Any level               |
| What is the primary focus?             | Learning by doing      | Achieving a goal         | Providing information    | Deepening understanding |
| How is the content structured?         | Step-by-step           | Problem-solution         | Organized facts          | Conceptual discussions  |
| Is it task-oriented?                   | Yes, guided tasks      | Yes, specific tasks      | No, informational        | No, conceptual          |
| Is it designed for linear progression? | Yes                    | No                       | No                       | No                      |

## Writing for each type

### Tutorials (Learning-oriented)

* **Audience goal**: Learn something new through step-by-step instructions.
* **Characteristics**: Sequential and assumes no prior knowledge.
* **Writing approach**:
  * Set expectations of what the user will achieve after reading.
  * Use clear, incremental steps. Minimize choices that need to be made by the user.
  * Point out milestones along the way.
  * Minimize theory and focus on concrete actions.

### How-To Guides (Problem-oriented)

* **Audience goal**: Perform a specific task correctly.
* **Characteristics**: Goal-driven and assumes some prior knowledge.
* **Writing approach**:
  * Write from the perspective of the user, not the product.
  * Describe a logical sequence and omit unnecessary details.
  * Minimize context beyond what is necessary.

### Reference (Information-oriented)

* **Audience goal**: Find details about a product's functionality.
* **Characteristics**: Unambiguous, product-focused, scannable.
* **Writing approach**:
  * Be scannable and concise.
  * Prioritize consistency.
  * Avoid explanatory content. Focus on examples that are easy to copy and modify.

### Explanation (Understanding-oriented)

* **Audience goal**: Expand general understanding of a concept or highly complex feature.
* **Characteristics**: Theoretical, potentially opinionated, broad in scope.
* **Writing approach**:
  * Provide background context, such as design decisions or technical constraints.
  * Acknowledge opinions and alternatives.
  * Draw connections to other areas in the product or industry.

## Tips and tricks

1. **Maintain purpose**: Before writing, assign each page a specific content type and make it top of mind in the doc throughout your writing.
2. **Consider content freshness**: Regardless of content type, try to optimize for evergreen documentation. If something represents a moment in time of what a feature looks like on a specific date, it's probably better suited for a changelog or blog post than in your documentation. Or if something changes very frequently avoid putting it in your docs.
3. **Think like your users**: Consider different user personas when organizing content. See [Understand your audience](/guides/understand-your-audience) for more information.

While the Diátaxis framework provides a starting point, successful documentation requires contextual adaptation to your product. Start by understanding the framework's principles, then adjust them to serve your users' needs.

# GEO guide: Optimize docs for AI search and answer engines
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/geo

Optimize your documentation for AI search and answer engines.

Optimize your documentation for both traditional search engines and AI-powered answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) focuses on being cited by AI systems through comprehensive content and structured information, while traditional SEO targets search result rankings.

## GEO quickstart

### Initial setup

1. **Make sure your docs are being indexed** in your `docs.json` settings
2. **Audit current pages** for missing descriptions and titles

### Content improvements

1. **Add comparison tables** to appropriate pages
2. **Audit headings** to ensure they answer common questions
3. **Improve internal linking** between related topics
4. **Test with AI tools** to verify accuracy

## GEO best practices

In general, well written and well structured documentation will have strong GEO. You should still prioritize writing for your users, and if your content is meeting their needs, you will be well on your way to optimizing for AI tools. Creating genuinely helpful content rather than optimizing for optimization's sake is rewarded by both traditional and AI search engines.

Focus on:

* Content aligned to user needs rather than keyword matching
* Structured, scannable information
* Direct answers to questions

### Format for clarity

These formatting practices help AI tools parse and understand your content:

* Don't skip heading levels (H1 → H2 → H3)
* Use specific object names instead of "it" or "this"
* Label code blocks with their programming language
* Give images descriptive alt text
* Link to related concepts to help AI understand relationships

### Answer questions directly

Write content that addresses specific user questions:

* Begin sections with the main takeaway
* Use descriptive headings that match common queries
* Break complex topics into numbered steps

## Mintlify configuration

Use these features to improve GEO.

### Add descriptive page metadata

Include clear titles and descriptions in your frontmatter:

```mdx  theme={null}
---
title: "API authentication guide"
description: "Complete guide to implementing API authentication with code examples"
---
```

### Configure global indexing settings

Add to your `docs.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "seo": {
    "indexing": "all",
    "metatags": {
      "og:type": "website",
      "og:site_name": "Your docs"
    }
  }
}
```

### LLMs.txt

LLMs.txt files help AI systems understand your documentation structure, similar to how sitemaps help search engines. Mintlify automatically generates LLMs.txt files for your docs. No configuration is required.

## Testing your documentation

Test various AI tools with questions about your product and documentation to see how well your docs are being cited.

**Ask AI assistants specific questions about your docs:**

* "How do I set up authentication using this API?"
* "Walk me through the installation process step by step"

**Check that tools provide:**

* Correct code samples
* Accurate step-by-step instructions


# Git concepts
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/git-concepts

Learn Git fundamentals of version control and collaboration for docs-as-code workflows.

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your documentation and collaborate with team members. With Git, for every file in your project, you can see what changed, when, and why. Git also makes it easy to revert to previous versions of files if you ever need to.

The web editor performs some Git operations behind the scenes. Understanding these concepts will help you work more effectively with the web editor and collaborate with team members who are working in their local development environments.

## Core Git concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository">
    Your documentation's source where all files and their history are stored. The web editor connects to your repository to access and modify content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Commit">
    A saved snapshot of your changes at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing what changed and creates a permanent record in your project history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch">
    A branch points to a specific commit in your repository. Your live documentation is built from a deployment branch. You can have any number of other branches with changes that are not yet published to your live documentation. If you want to incorporate the changes from a branch into your live documentation, you can merge the branch into your deployment branch through a pull request.

    Use branches to work on changes without affecting your live documentation, safely experiment with new features, and get reviews before publishing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deployment branch">
    The primary branch of your project that your live documentation content is built from. Changes to this branch are automatically published to your documentation site. Often called `main`, but you can set any branch as your deployment branch.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pull request">
    A way to propose merging your changes on a branch into your live documentation. Allows for review and discussion before changes go live. Commonly called a PR, and also called a merge request in GitLab.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Diff">
    A diff (or difference) shows the changes between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight what has been added, removed, or modified, making it easy to identify what changed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How the web editor uses Git

The web editor connects to your Git repository through the [GitHub App](/deploy/github) or [GitLab integration](/deploy/gitlab) and automates common Git operations.

When you:

* **Open a file**: The editor fetches the latest version from your repository, ensuring you're always working with up to date content.
* **Make changes**: The editor tracks your changes as a draft that can become a commit when you're ready to save your work.
* **Save changes**: The editor makes a commit with your changes, preserving your work in the project history.
* **Create a branch**: The editor creates a new branch in your repository that can be used by anyone with access to the repository so they can collaborate and review changes.
* **Publish on your deployment branch**: The editor commits and pushes directly to your deployment branch, which publishes your changes immediately.
* **Publish on other branches**: The editor creates a pull request, which allows you to get feedback from others before merging your changes into your deployment branch.

## Git best practices

Every team will develop their own workflows and preferences, but these are some general best practices to get you started.

* **Write descriptive commit messages**: Be specific about what changed using active language.
* **Use descriptive branch names**: Branch names should explain the work being done and be meaningful to someone who is looking at the branches in your repository.
* **Keep branches focused**: Keep the changes on a branch focused on a specific task or project.
* **Delete branches after merging**: Delete branches when you no longer need them to keep your repository tidy.


# Improve your docs
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/improving-docs

Use data and metrics to improve your documentation.

<Tip>
  This page explains how to measure the success of your documentation with quantitative metrics, qualitative feedback, and alignment with business goals.
</Tip>

## Quantitative metrics

Some examples to consider:

* **Page views**: Views can be a good proxy for success, but could be driven by bot traffic or repeat visitors. If you're getting many views on an errors or explainer page, it might signal an issue with your broader product.
* **Time on page**: Longer time on page might signal engagement, but could also mean users are stuck trying to find the information they need.
* **Bounce rate**: A high bounce rate could mean users didn't find what they needed, or it could mean they found exactly what they needed and left satisfied.

The key is to compare these metrics over time or against a baseline to spot trends and understand if they align with users achieving their goals.

### Correlate traffic and satisfaction

Use insights to identify patterns:

* **High traffic and low feedback scores**: Popular pages with a poor user experience. Prioritize improving these pages.
* **Low traffic and high feedback scores**: Documentation that is working well, but might not be discoverable. Consider promoting these pages.
* **High traffic and high feedback scores**: Your documentation's greatest hits. Review these pages for ideas to improve the rest of your content.

## Qualitative feedback

Add context to your quantitative metrics with qualitative information:

* **User feedback**: Use [feedback](/insights/feedback) to capture user sentiment through ratings and open-ended comments, helping you understand what works and where users struggle.
* **Stakeholder input**: Get regular feedback from teams like support, engineering, and customer success to uncover common issues users face and areas for improvement.
* **User testing**: Conduct usability tests to validate whether users can find the answers they need and whether your documentation aligns with their expectations. See [Understand your audience](/guides/understand-your-audience) for more on user research.

## Business alignment

Measure documentation against broader business objectives:

* **Support efficiency**: Track whether your documentation reduces the volume of support tickets or improves satisfaction scores, indicating it's meeting user needs.
* **Onboarding and adoption**: Monitor how well documentation supports new users in getting up to speed, contributing to faster product adoption.
* **Retention**: Well-maintained, easy-to-follow docs contribute to positive user experiences, helping to reduce churn and improve retention rates.

## Put insights into action

Use these patterns to prioritize your documentation improvements:

* **Fix high-impact problems first**: Popular pages with poor feedback scores affect the most users.
* **Respond to user feedback**: Contextual and code snippet feedback can identify specific areas for improvement.
* **Focus on key user journeys**: Prioritize pages connected to the most important tasks for your product.

# Create a knowledge base
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/knowledge-base

Host your internal knowledge base on Mintlify to consolidate information for your team, improve search, and reduce maintenance burden.

## Introduction

This guide shows you how to create an internal knowledge base on Mintlify. You'll set up a navigation structure, migrate content, configure authentication, and establish a maintenance process.

This guide assumes you are migrating content from an existing knowledge base to Mintlify. If you are creating a knowledge base with entirely new content, you can follow similar steps but skip the audit and migration steps.

If you haven't created a Mintlify project yet, see the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to deploy your site.

### Prerequisites

* An authentication system (SSO or OAuth provider like Okta or Azure AD)
* Control over your domain for hosting
* Admin access to your Mintlify organization

## Audit existing content

Catalog the content you currently have in your existing knowledge base. This helps you understand what content you need to migrate, plan how to organize it in your new knowledge base, identify any gaps in your content, and confirm that you moved all of your content to your new knowledge base.

* **Total number of articles**: Helps estimate migration effort and track completeness.
* **Topics and content**: Informs your navigation structure and content organization.
* **Current organization**: See how your content is currently organized and whether it matches your desired structure.
* **Content types**: Determine any content conversion requirements for text, PDFs, videos, and embedded content.
* **Metadata**: Identify any metadata that needs to be preserved like dates, authors, and tags.
* **Access requirements**: Determine the best authentication approach for your knowledge base.

## Export your existing content

Most knowledge base platforms support exporting content in standard formats. The format you choose depends on your current platform and your priorities.

* Export to **Markdown** for the simplest migration to Mintlify. (recommended)
* Export to **HTML** if Markdown isn't available. You must convert your content to Markdown later.
* Export to **JSON or CSV** if you have structured metadata to preserve.

## Design the navigation structure

Your navigation structure determines how people find content in your knowledge base. You can recreate your existing structure or redesign it to better match how your team thinks about the content.

<Tip>
  Migrating is a good time to improve your structure. Consider whether your current organization actually works for your team, or if you can reorganize to make information easier to find.
</Tip>

Your `docs.json` file defines how your knowledge base is organized. Create this file at the root of your project repository.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Finance",
        "pages": [
            "finance/overview",
            "finance/budgeting-process",
            "finance/expense-reports",
            "finance/cost-allocation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "HR",
        "pages": [
            "hr/overview",
            "hr/onboarding",
            "hr/benefits",
            "hr/time-off-policy"
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Engineering",
        "pages": [
          "engineering/overview",
          "engineering/dev-setup",
          "engineering/deployment",
          "engineering/code-standards"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See [Navigation](/organize/navigation) for more information on how to structure your knowledge base.

## Set up authentication

Determine who needs access to what content in your knowledge base.

If everyone should have access to the entire knowledge base, set up only [authentication](/deploy/authentication-setup).

If you need to restrict access to certain content to specific users or groups, set up authentication and [personalization](/deploy/personalization-setup).

## Migrate your content

Move your exported content into a folder structure that matches the navigation structure you designed. Convert content to Markdown if needed, add any missing frontmatter, and set up internal links.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Organize files">
    Create folders that match your `docs.json` structure. For example, if your `docs.json` has a Finance group, create a `finance/` folder:

    ```text  theme={null}
    your-project/
    ├── docs.json
    ├── finance/
    │   ├── overview.mdx
    │   ├── budgeting-process.mdx
    │   ├── expense-reports.mdx
    │   └── cost-allocation.mdx
    ├── hr/
    │   ├── overview.mdx
    │   ├── onboarding.mdx
    │   ├── benefits.mdx
    │   └── time-off-policy.mdx
    └── engineering/
        ├── overview.mdx
        ├── dev-setup.mdx
        ├── deployment.mdx
        └── code-standards.mdx
    ```

    Place each article in its corresponding folder. The file path must match the path in your `docs.json`. For example, if `docs.json` references `"finance/expense-reports"`, the file should be `finance/expense-reports.mdx` in your project repository.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add frontmatter to each article">
    Every `.mdx` file needs frontmatter at the top with metadata. Every page requires a title and description. See [Pages](/organize/pages) for more information on page metadata.

    ```mdx  theme={null}
    ---
    title: "Expense Report Process"
    description: "How to submit and track expense reports"
    ---

    Your content here...
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up internal links">
    Link between pages using paths from your project root.

    ```mdx  theme={null}
    See [Onboarding Guide](/hr/onboarding) for new employee setup.

    For questions, contact [HR Benefits Team](/hr/benefits#common-questions).
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Convert HTML and other formats to Markdown">
    If you exported your content as HTML, convert it to Markdown. Some tools that can help include:

    * **Pandoc**: Command-line tool that converts between many formats.
    * **CloudConvert**: Online converter supporting HTML, DOCX, PDF, and more.
    * **VS Code extensions**: Search for "HTML to Markdown" in extensions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle multiple content formats">
    If you have PDFs, videos, or other media, decide how to include them in your knowledge base.

    * **Embed videos**: Embed videos or link to hosted videos.
    * **Link to PDFs**: Add PDFs to your project repository and link to them from relevant pages.
    * **Convert PDFs to Markdown**: If you want the content of a PDF to be a page, convert PDFs to Markdown.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optimize discoverability

### Configure AI assistant

The [assistant](/ai/assistant) is automatically enabled for Pro and Custom plans. You can customize the assistant from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/assistant/settings).

* **Search sites**: Select additional sites other than your knowledge base that the assistant can search when responding to questions.
* **Set sample questions**: Set default questions that appear when someone opens the assistant panel. If people have frequent questions like "how do I submit an expense report" or "what is the company's vacation policy", add them here to save people time.

### Slack integration

If your team uses Slack, you can add the [Slack app](/ai/slack-app) to your workspace. This lets your team query your knowledge base without leaving Slack.

## Establish maintenance workflows

A knowledge base can decay quickly without maintenance. Set up systems to keep content up to date and help your team contribute to the knowledge base.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign content ownership">
    Designate an owner or small team for each section. They don't have to write all the content, but they're responsible for:

    * Reviewing content regularly.
    * Flagging outdated information.
    * Approving new pages in their section.
    * Responding when people report errors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up review cycles and content verification">
    Content becomes stale over time. Establish a review schedule.

    * **Critical content**: Review every 30 days
    * **Standard content**: Review every 90 days
    * **Evergreen content**: Review yearly

    When reviewing, check:

    * Are links still valid?
    * Have systems or processes changed?
    * Are examples current?
    * Is there new information that should be added?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create contribution guidelines">
    Make it easy for anyone to improve the knowledge base. Your guidelines should cover:

    * **Format**: Do you have specific templates or format requirements?
    * **Process**: How should someone propose and submit changes?
    * **Review**: Who reviews submissions? What's the turnaround time?
    * **Scope**: What types of content are in scope?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor usage metrics">
    Review how your team uses the knowledge base to prioritize content and identify areas for improvement. Set a regular cadence for reviewing usage metrics—monthly or quarterly are good intervals.

    * Which articles get the most views? Invest in keeping these accurate and easy to read.
    * Which articles get no views? Consider removing them or improving discoverability.
    * What's the bounce rate? If people leave immediately, the content might not be helpful or navigation could be improved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Your knowledge base is ready to launch. After deploying:

1. Announce the knowledge base to your team.
2. Monitor usage and search patterns in your analytics.
3. Encourage contributions when people find gaps.
4. Review and update content regularly.

The most successful knowledge bases evolve based on how teams actually use them.


# Maintenance
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/maintenance

Keep your documentation accurate and up-to-date over time.

<Tip>
  This page explains strategies for keeping your documentation accurate and valuable over time, from automated checks to content lifecycles.
</Tip>

## Automate what you can

Introduce automations where you can, such as:

* **Track stale content:** Run a script to flag important docs that haven't been updated in the last three months. Are they still accurate?
* **Automate documentation updates:** Build a workflow to automatically update documentation when code is merged with the [agent API](/guides/automate-agent).
* **Enforce standards with linters:** Use [Vale](http://Vale.sh) or [CI checks](/deploy/ci) to automatically catch formatting issues, writing style deviations, or missing metadata on every pull request.

## Set up a review process

Documentation might never be perfect, and that's okay. You should have a threshold of acceptance where documentation is functional and useful.

Balance efficiency with quality:

* **Focus on high-impact docs.** Not every page needs regular updates. Make sure the most important pages are reviewed regularly for accuracy and relevance.
* **Leverage your community.** If your docs are open-source, empower users to flag issues or submit fixes via pull requests. This builds trust and keeps content fresh.

## Know when to rewrite

Over time, documentation naturally accumulates caveats and workarounds. When incremental fixes create more confusion than clarity, a full overhaul might be the best option.

* **Plan for periodic resets.** A major cleanup, especially if best practices or the product itself has evolved significantly, saves time for your team and your users.
* **Start with a structured audit.** Interview support teams, analyze user feedback, and document what is missing, misleading, or redundant before rewriting.
* **Complete rewrites in focused sprints.** A full overhaul doesn't have to happen all at once. Prioritize sections with the biggest impact.

## Wrong docs can be worse than no docs

Outdated or misleading documentation wastes users' time and erodes trust. In cases where a page is completely inaccurate and unfixable in the short term, it's often better to remove it entirely. Users will appreciate having less information over having wrong information.


# Media
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/media

Use media effectively while managing maintenance burden.

<Tip>
  This page explains best practices for using screenshots, GIFs, and videos in your documentation.
</Tip>

Screenshots, GIFs, and videos can enhance documentation but require ongoing maintenance as UI elements change. Use them selectively to avoid unnecessary upkeep.

Key guidelines:

* **Media should be supplementary.** If a workflow is clear in text alone, avoid adding visuals.
* **Ensure accessibility.** Add alt text for images, subtitles for videos, and transcripts for audio content. Many people use assistive technology and accessible content benefits all users.
* **Balance clarity with maintainability.** Frequent UI changes can make screenshots and videos outdated quickly. Consider whether the effort to update them is worth the value they add.

## When to use media

* **Screenshots** for tasks that are difficult to explain with words.
* **GIFs** for promotional purposes and short yet complex workflows.
* **Videos** for abstract concepts and long workflows.

Use media sparingly and intentionally to avoid unnecessary documentation debt. When done right, it enhances comprehension without adding maintenance burdens or accessibility barriers.


# Migrating MDX API pages to OpenAPI navigation
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/migrating-from-mdx

Migrate to automated OpenAPI generation with flexible navigation.

If you are currently using individual MDX pages for your API endpoints, you can migrate to autogenerating pages from your OpenAPI specification while retaining the customizability of individual pages. This can help you reduce the number of files you need to maintain and improve the consistency of your API documentation.

You can define metadata and content for each endpoint in your OpenAPI specification and organize endpoints where you want them in your navigation.

## CLI migration

The `mint migrate-mdx` command is the recommended way to migrate from MDX endpoint pages to autogenerated pages.

This command:

* Parses your `docs.json` navigation structure.
* Identifies MDX pages that generate OpenAPI endpoint pages.
* Extracts content from MDX files and moves it to the `x-mint` extension in your OpenAPI specification.
* Updates your `docs.json` to reference the OpenAPI endpoints directly instead of MDX files.
* Deletes the original MDX endpoint files.

<Info>
  If you already have `x-mint` defined for an endpoint and also have an MDX page with content for that endpoint, the MDX content will overwrite existing `x-mint` settings.

  If you have multiple MDX pages for the same endpoint with different content, the script will use the content from the page that appears last in your `docs.json`.

  The migration tool does not support previewing changes before applying them.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your OpenAPI specification.">
    Ensure your OpenAPI specification is valid and includes all endpoints you want to document.

    Any MDX pages you want to migrate must have the `openapi:` frontmatter referencing an endpoint.

    <Tip>
      Validate your OpenAPI file using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint).
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Mint CLI">
    If needed, install or update the [Mint CLI](/installation).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the migration command.">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    mint migrate-mdx
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual migration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your OpenAPI specification.">
    Ensure your OpenAPI specification is valid and includes all endpoints you want to document.

    For any endpoints that you want to customize the metadata or content, add the `x-mint` extension to the endpoint. See [x-mint extension](/api-playground/openapi-setup#x-mint-extension) for more details.

    For any endpoints that you want to exclude from your documentation, add the `x-hidden` extension to the endpoint.

    <Info>
      Validate your OpenAPI file using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint).
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update your navigation structure.">
    Replace MDX page references with OpenAPI endpoints in your `docs.json`.

    ```json  theme={null}
    "navigation": {

  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove old MDX files.">
    After verifying your new navigation works correctly, remove the MDX endpoint files that you no longer need.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigation patterns

You can customize how your API documentation appears in your navigation.

### Mixed content navigation

Combine automatically generated API pages with other pages:

```json  theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "openapi.json",
      "pages": [
        "api/overview",
        "GET /users",
        "POST /users",
        "api/authentication"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple API versions

Organize different API versions using tabs or groups:

```json  theme={null}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API v1",
      "openapi": "specs/v1.json"
    },
    {
      "tab": "API v2",
      "openapi": "specs/v2.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## When to use individual MDX pages

Consider keeping individual MDX pages when you need:

* Extensive custom content per endpoint like React components or lengthy examples.
* Unique page layouts.
* Experimental documentation approaches for specific endpoints.

For most use cases, OpenAPI navigation provides better maintainability and consistency.


# Organize navigation
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/navigation

Design information architecture that aligns with user needs.

<Tip>
  This page explains why and how to organize your documentation in a way that makes sense for your users.
</Tip>

## Why is navigation important?

Navigation might seem unimportant because experienced users looking for specific answers typically navigate directly to pages via a search engine or your documentation site's search bar.

But the information architecture of your documentation helps people build a mental model for how to think about your product, and provides structure for people and AI tools that use your documentation. Well designed navigation helps people quickly grasp your product and succeed when using your documentation.

## Map the foundation with stakeholders

Align with key stakeholders like your founders, product managers, or engineering leads on how your product works, what's most important, and how users should interact with it.

Example questions to ask:

* What's the simplest way to explain how the product works?
* What are the product's core building blocks?
* How do users typically adopt the product? Where do people most often get stuck?
* How does the product's architecture influence how people use it?
* What are the most important integrations or dependencies?
* What is changing or evolving in the product?
* If the product was broken into different layers, what would they be? Would it be by tasks that people perform or by features that people use?

## Validate your assumptions

Once you've established a structure, you need to validate whether it actually works for real users. The way people navigate your documentation often reveals gaps in your information architecture that internal teams might overlook.

### Track real user journeys

Use tools like session replays (for example, [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com), [Hotjar](https://www.hotjar.com)) or analytics (for example, [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com)) to study how users move through your docs. Pay attention to:

* **Entry points:** Where do users start their journey? Are they coming from search, a support ticket, or directly from your product?
* **Navigation patterns:** Do they follow the expected navigation structure, or do they take unexpected detours?
* **Friction points:** Where do users pause, loop back, or abandon their session? These could indicate unclear organization or missing content.
* **Search behavior:** Are users searching for terms that don't exist in your documentation? This might highlight gaps in your content or misalignment in terminology.

### Test with real users

Analytics help surface trends, but direct conversations provide deeper insights.

Get on research calls where customers attempt to find answers to specific questions. Ask them to narrate their thought process as they navigate.

New hires are also a great proxy for users since they don't have as much prior context as tenured members of your team. Before they get too familiar with your product from the inside, ask them to complete a task using only the documentation.

Have them outline in detail how they approached the task. Where they clicked first, how they interpreted section names, and where they got stuck. Their instincts can reveal whether your docs are intuitive or if they assume too much knowledge.

## Identify common challenges

Based on your observations, look for these common navigation problems:

* **Overloaded categories:** Too many top-level sections can overwhelm users. Consider grouping related topics together.
* **Hidden essential content:** Don't bury critical information. Prioritize frequently accessed content.
* **Unclear section names:** If users hesitate before clicking, your labels might not be intuitive. Align terminology with how your audience naturally thinks.

Try to design an elegant and functional information architecture, but remember, it's hard to make documentation that works for absolutely everyone. Consider the majority of your users and what will help them succeed.

## Iterate over time

Above all, stay flexible. Your navigation should evolve with your product and user needs. You don't have to be right on the first try.


# SEO
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/seo

Improve SEO to increase documentation discoverability.

<Tip>
  This page explains fundamental strategies to optimize your documentation SEO.
</Tip>

## Content basics

Make your writing and structure easy for search engines to scan.

* **Headings and subheadings:** Use sequential, meaningful headers to structure your content. Each page has an H1 created from the `title:` property in the frontmatter.
* **Short paragraphs and bullet points:** Break down large chunks of text into easily readable sections. Use bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate.
* **Internal linking:** Link to related content using descriptive anchor text. For example, "Learn more about rate limiting" instead of "Click here."

## Technical SEO basics

Once your content is optimized, ensure your documentation performs well from a technical standpoint.

These basic technical SEO practices help make your docs more discoverable:

* **Meta tags and descriptions:** Craft SEO-friendly titles (50-60 characters) and descriptions (150-160 characters) for each page. Most [meta tags](/optimize/seo) are automatically generated.
* **Alt text for images:** Provide descriptive alt text for images with relevant keywords. For example, "OAuth 2.0 API authentication flow" instead of just "diagram". This enhances SEO and accessibility.
* **Sitemaps:** Ensure your sitemap is up-to-date. Mintlify automatically generates a sitemap. However, you can manually create a sitemap if you prefer a custom format. Once created, search engines index site maps over time, but you can submit your sitemap directly to Google Search Console to speed up the process.

## Page performance

Use tools like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev) to identify areas for technical SEO improvement.

Examples of more advanced optimizations:

* **Optimize media for speed:** Compress images using formats like WebP or AVIF and ensure your pages load quickly (ideally under 3 seconds).
* **Structured data (schema markup):** Add schema markup (like HowTo, FAQ) to your pages to help search engines better understand and rank your content.

## Keyword research

To increase organic traffic, invest time into understanding which keywords help users land on your documentation.

* **Keyword research:** Use free tools like [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword-planner/) or [Keywords Everywhere](https://keywordseverywhere.com) to identify common phrases or long-tail keywords.
* **Integrate keywords naturally:** Add keywords naturally into headings, subheadings, and throughout the body text. Don't overstuff keywords. Your documentation should be written for your users, not search engines.


# Style and tone
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/style-and-tone

Write effective technical documentation with consistent style.

<Tip>
  This page explains stylistic choices, common mistakes, and implementation tips for writing technical documentation.
</Tip>

## Writing principles

* **Be concise.** People are reading documentation to achieve a goal. Get to the point quickly.
* **Clarity over cleverness.** Be simple, direct, and avoid jargon or complex sentence structure.
* **Use active voice.** Instead of saying "A configuration file should be created," use "Create a configuration file."
* **Be skimmable.** Use headlines to orient readers. Break up text-heavy paragraphs. Use bullet points and lists to make it easier to scan.
* **Write in second person.** Referring to your reader makes it easier to follow instructions and makes the documentation feel more personal.

## Common writing mistakes

* **Spelling and grammar mistakes.** Even a few spelling and grammar mistakes in your documentation make it less credible and harder to read.
* **Inconsistent terminology.** Calling something an “API key” in one paragraph then “API token” in the next makes it difficult for users to follow along.
* **Product-centric terminology.** Your users don't have the full context of your product. Use language that your users are familiar with.
* **Colloquialisms.** Especially for localization, colloquialisms hurt clarity.

## Tips for enforcing style

Leverage existing style guides to standardize your documentation:

* [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
* [Splunk Style Guide](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/StyleGuide/current/StyleGuide/Howtouse)
* [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style)

When you know which writing principles you want to implement, automate as much as you can. You can use  [CI checks](/deploy/ci) or linters like [Vale](https://vale.sh).

# Understand your audience
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/understand-your-audience

Keep user goals at the center of your documentation.

<Tip>
  This page explains how to identify your audience, conduct user research, and write with their needs in mind.
</Tip>

## Identify your primary audience

Writing for multiple audiences leads to compromises that satisfy no one. Each piece of content should be focused on one specific user persona.

Your audience might be:

* Technical decision makers evaluating your product who want to understand higher level details like architecture overviews.
* New users who want to start using your product for the first time.
* Developers responsible for integrating your product who need instructions for a specific task.

Before writing any page, ask what is your reader trying to accomplish and what is their prior knowledge?

## User research is key

Your team should agree on who your primary audience is, but don't rely on intuition alone. The best insights come from talking directly to users. There can be a disconnect between how we think about our own products and how people actually use them.

Talk to users to understand:

* How do they describe what your product does?
* Do they use any unexpected words or names to describe your product?
* What do they wish they had more knowledge of?
* What is explicitly missing from your documentation?

Talking to users directly helps ground your writing from their perspective so that you write documentation that is helpful to them and gets them closer to their goals.

## Tips and tricks for understanding your audience

1. **Get embedded with support.** You'll see the pain points that incomplete documentation causes. Ask your support team how people think about the product and what are the most common problems people encounter.
2. **Incorporate feedback mechanisms.** Whether it's thumbs up/down or plain text fields, give users the opportunity to provide feedback as they read your documentation.
3. **Use analytics to guide you.** Review feedback and insights to understand where users are struggling and where they are successful. Make updates to the documentation that people struggle with or is most connected to the key tasks for your product.

There will always be edge cases that are not covered by your documentation. Prioritize the most impactful pages to help the most people. Too much content becomes difficult to navigate and maintain, so trying to document every possible scenario can be counterproductive.


# Windsurf
Source: https://mintlify.com/docs/guides/windsurf

Configure Windsurf to be your writing assistant.

Transform Windsurf into a documentation expert that understands your style guide, components, and project context through workspace rules and memories.

## Using Windsurf with Mintlify

Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant can be tuned to write documentation according to your standards using Mintlify components. Workspace rules and memories provide persistent context about your project, ensuring more consistent suggestions from Cascade.

* **Workspace rules** are stored in your documentation repository and shared with your team.
* **Memories** provide individual context that builds up over time.

We recommend setting up workspace rules for shared documentation standards. You can develop memories as you work, but since they are not shared, they will not be consistent across team members.

Create workspace rules in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your docs repo. See [Memories & Rules](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/memories) in the Windsurf documentation for more information.

## Example workspace rule

This rule provides Cascade with context about Mintlify components and general technical writing best practices.

You can use this example rule as-is or customize it for your documentation:

* **Writing standards**: Update language guidelines to match your style guide.
* **Component patterns**: Add project-specific components or modify existing examples.
* **Code examples**: Replace generic examples with real API calls and responses for your product.
* **Style and tone preferences**: Adjust terminology, formatting, and other rules.

Save your rule as a `.md` file in the `.windsurf/rules` directory of your docs repo.

## Enabling Data Privacy Integrations

You can add data privacy platforms onto your docs. Add the `integrations` field into your `docs.json` file with your respective scripts.

```json  theme={null}
  "integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
  }
```

## Cookie Consent and Disabling Telemetry

If you need to check if a user has already consented to cookies for GDPR compliance, you can specify a local storage key and value under `cookies`:

```json  theme={null}
  "integrations": {
    "cookies": {
      "key": "LOCAL STORAGE KEY",
      "value": "LOCAL STORAGE VALUE"
    }
  }
```

If these values are set, local storage will be checked to see if the user has consented to cookies. If they have not, telemetry will be disabled.

If you'd like to disable telemetry for all users, you can add the following to your `docs.json` file:

```json  theme={null}
  "integrations": {
    "telemetry": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
```

<Note>
  If you disable telemetry, you cannot collect feedback on your documentation pages, even if you enable feedback in your dashboard.

### Update your `docs.json` configuration file

Add the combined spec URL to an **Anchors** or **Tabs** section in your `docs.json` file.

Add the combined spec URL to an anchor by updating the `anchor` field in your `docs.json` file as follows:

```json docs.json theme={null}
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

Add the combined spec URL to a tab by updating the `tab` field in the `docs.json` file as follows:

```json docs.json theme={null}
{
  "tabs": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "url": "api-reference",
      // !mark
      "openapi": "SPEAKEASY_COMBINED_SPEC_URL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Speakeasy-generated code snippets can now be viewed in your API docs and interacted with in the playground.
