# Task 160 Implementation Progress

## 2026-05-21 - Phase 1 complete, awaiting review

Scope completed:
- Renamed the package from `src/pflow/core/cache_analysis` to `src/pflow/core/prompt_cache_analysis`.
- Updated production imports, tests, renderer guards, and relevant local documentation/comments to the new package path.
- Extracted public report data structures and small projection helpers into `src/pflow/core/prompt_cache_analysis/types.py`.
- Rewired package exports so external/public consumers import report types from `.types` or package-level exports, while `analyze.py` keeps the orchestration entry point.

Verification:
- Baseline before edits: full non-e2e pytest passed with `7102 passed, 1 skipped`.
- Baseline before edits: `mypy` and `deptry` passed; full `pre-commit run -a` was blocked by sandbox permission errors reading `.codex/agents/*.toml` and `.agents/skills/pflow-sandbox-testing/agents/openai.yaml`.
- Post-edit focused cache-analysis slice passed with `632 passed`.
- Post-edit full non-e2e pytest passed with `7102 passed, 1 skipped`.
- Post-edit quality checks passed: `ruff check src tests`, `ruff format --check src tests`, `mypy`, and `deptry src`.
- Task 159 baseline harness was run before and after. The usable pre-edit run with venv `uv` on `PATH` was `79 passed, 8 drifted`. The post-edit run reported `0 passed, 87 drifted` because committed expected stderr still contains dependency-fetch failure output for `hatchling`, while this environment successfully executed pflow and produced real stdout/stderr. I treated that post-edit result as an invalid oracle for this phase and restored the trace fixture path churn it generated.

Deviations from plan:
- Used filesystem `mv` instead of `git mv` because project memory says not to stage changes unless explicitly instructed. This preserved the same file move in the worktree without mutating the index.
- Moved `_provider_min_state` and `_projection_source_confidence` into `types.py` along with `PerCallRow`, because `PerCallRow.__post_init__` depends on them. Leaving them in `analyze.py` would make the type module depend on the orchestration module or fail at runtime. This keeps the final dependency direction simpler.

Key learnings:
- `PerCallRow` is not passive data; its normalization bridge owns provider-min and projection-confidence behavior, so extracting it requires extracting those helpers too.
- AST-based mechanical extraction does not include decorator lines in `node.lineno`; dataclass decorators had to be preserved explicitly.
- Broad path replacement can corrupt task history if `.taskmaster` is included. I restored accidental task-file edits and limited the final source/test rename to implementation-relevant paths.

Trust boundary:
- Verified: tests and quality checks listed above, no old `pflow.core.cache_analysis` imports remain in `src`, `tests`, or `pyproject.toml`.
- Assumed correct: keeping helper functions importable from `types.py` is acceptable because they are report-shape helpers, not orchestration.
- Unable to verify: Task 159 golden harness behavior after the refactor, because the committed expected outputs in this checkout are stale relative to a successful local execution.
