# Task 48: Implement MCP Server for pflow

This mcp server will be installed into AI agents to allow them to see pflow workflows and invoke them as mcp tools.

They will be added and hot reloaded if users choose to add them as mcp tools when saving workflows. This is optional, workflows that are saved will always be available as cli commands.
