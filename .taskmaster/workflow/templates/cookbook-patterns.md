# Cookbook Pattern Analysis for [Task/Subtask ID]

**File Location**: `.taskmaster/tasks/task_[X]/cookbook-patterns.md` or `.taskmaster/tasks/task_[X]/subtask_[X.Y]/refinement/cookbook-patterns.md`

*Created during: [Task decomposition / Subtask refinement]*

## Purpose
Document cookbook examples analyzed and patterns extracted for implementation.

## Cookbook Examples Analyzed

### 1. **[Example Name]** (`pocketflow/cookbook/[folder-name]/`)
**Why relevant**: [How this example relates to the current task]

**Key patterns extracted**:
- **[Pattern Name]**: [Description of the pattern]
  - Code location: [file:line in the example]
  - How it solves: [What problem it addresses]
  - Our use case: [How we'll apply it]

**Code to adapt**:
```[language]
# From cookbook example
[relevant code snippet]
```

**Planned adaptations**:
- Change [X] to [Y] because [reason]
- Add [feature] for [purpose]
- Remove [part] as not needed

**Risk assessment**:
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]
- Fallback: [Alternative if this doesn't work]

### 2. **[Another Example]** (`pocketflow/cookbook/[folder-name]/`)
[Follow same structure]

### 3. **[Third Example]** (if applicable)
[Follow same structure]

## Pattern Synthesis

### Primary Implementation Strategy
Based on cookbook analysis, the implementation will:
1. Start with [pattern] from [example] as the foundation
2. Incorporate [feature] from [example] for [purpose]
3. Adapt [approach] from [example] to handle [requirement]

### Key Differences from Cookbook
Our implementation differs because:
- [Requirement X] not covered in examples
- [Constraint Y] requires modification
- [Feature Z] needs custom approach

### Testing Strategy (from cookbook)
Examples demonstrate these testing approaches:
- From [example]: [testing pattern]
- From [example]: [validation approach]
- Will adapt: [how we'll test]

## Implementation Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Core pattern identified and understood
- [ ] Code snippets extracted for reuse
- [ ] Adaptations clearly defined
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Testing approach planned
- [ ] Fallback options identified

## Questions/Uncertainties
1. [Any aspects unclear from cookbook examples]
2. [Patterns that might not fit perfectly]
3. [Areas where examples conflict]

## Additional Resources Needed
- [ ] Need to study: [Related documentation]
- [ ] Need to understand: [Dependency or tool]
- [ ] Need to clarify: [Ambiguous aspect]

*This analysis forms the bridge between understanding and implementation. Update as new insights emerge during coding.*
