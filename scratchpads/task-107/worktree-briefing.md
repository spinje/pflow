# Task 107: Worktree Briefing

## Worktree Details

- **Path**: `/Users/andfal/projects/pflow-feat-markdown-workflow-format`
- **Branch**: `feat/markdown-workflow-format`
- **Task**: Task 107 — Implement Markdown Workflow Format

## Context

You are now in an isolated git worktree specifically created for this task. This is a complex task and we have previously made progress by designing the feature one hard decision at a time.

## Instructions

First, evaluate the current plan and then verify it against the codebase to find the final wrong assumptions we have been making and clear all ambiguity and contradictions.

### Required Reading

1. `.taskmaster/tasks/task_107/task-107.md`
2. `.taskmaster/tasks/task_107/starting-context/format-specification.md`
3. `.taskmaster/tasks/task_107/implementation/implementation-plan.md`

### Objectives

1. Find **internal contradictions** within and between the documents
2. Identify as many things as possible that need to be explored further
3. Think deeply about how this should be implemented and everything we need to know about the codebase to integrate this feature perfectly
4. Create a detailed plan for the implementation that makes no assumptions and reduces the risk of speedbumps in implementation as low as possible.
