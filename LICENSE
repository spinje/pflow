to an open source license after two years.

## Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, we grant you a non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software
for any purpose, except as restricted below.

## Limitations

You may not provide the Software to others as a managed service or as a service
where the Software provides the primary value of the service. For example, you cannot
offer a hosted service that allows third parties to use the Software to create and
run their own workflows without adding substantial additional value.

from the Software.

Effective on the second anniversary of the Software's initial publication
(January 1, 2028), the Software will be made available under the Apache-2.0 license.
On that date, the above limitations will no longer apply, and you may use the
Software under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT
