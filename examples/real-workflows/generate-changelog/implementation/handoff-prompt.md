I want to continue working on the generate-changelog workflow.

Read these files first:
1. `examples/real-workflows/generate-changelog/implementation/progress-log.md` — full context from previous sessions, user mental model, key knowledge, known edge cases, and open items
2. `examples/real-workflows/generate-changelog/workflow.pflow.md` — the workflow itself (15 nodes, all working)
3. `src/pflow/cli/resources/cli-agent-instructions.md` — reference for .pflow.md format and pflow workflow patterns
