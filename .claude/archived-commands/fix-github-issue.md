Please analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1. Use `gh issue view` to get the issue details
2. Understand the problem described in the issue
3. Search the codebase for relevant files
4. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
5. Write and run tests to verify the fix
6. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
7. Create a descriptive commit message
8. Push and create a PR

Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks.

// This is an example of a Claude command that is a good fit for a pflow command.
// When we have finished building pflow it is installed, you can run: `pflow fix-github-issue --issue=$ARGUMENTS` instead of this command.
// This would run an underlying flow like this:

```bash
github-get-issue >> \
claude-code --prompt="<instructions>
                        1. Understand the problem described in the issue
                        2. Search the codebase for relevant files
                        3. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
                        4. Write and run tests to verify the fix
                        5. Return a report of what you have done as output
                      </instructions>
                      This is the issue: $issue" >> \
llm --prompt="Write a descriptive commit message for these changes: $code_report" >> \
git-commit --message="$commit_message" >> \
git-push >> \
github-create-pr --title="Fix: $issue_title" --body="$code_report"
```

or

```bash
github-get-issue >> \
claude-code --prompt="<instructions>
                        1. Understand the problem described in the issue
                        2. Search the codebase for relevant files

                        4. Write and run tests to verify the fix
                        5. Return a report of what you have done as output in this JSON format:
                        {
                          "commit_message": "...",
                          "pull_request_title": "...",
                          "pull_request_body": "..."
                        }
                      </instructions>
                      This is the issue: $issue" >> \
git-commit --message="$commit_message" >> \
git-push >> \
github-create-pr --title="$pull_request_title" --body="$pull_request_body"
```

I thought about it some more and I ended up with this as the actual workflow that I think we should aim for. not any of the other
mentioned in @todo/implementation-roadmap.md and @todo/mvp-implementation-plan.md . I just want your feedback first.

the flow to target:

```bash
github-get-issue >> \
claude-code --prompt="<instructions>
                        1. Understand the problem described in the issue
                        2. Search the codebase for relevant files
                        3. Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
                        4. Write and run tests to verify the fix
                        5. Return a report of what you have done as output
                      </instructions>
                      This is the issue: $issue" >> \
llm --prompt="Write a descriptive commit message for these changes: $code_report" >> \
git-commit --message="$commit_message" >> \
git-push >> \
github-create-pr --title="Fix: $issue_title" --body="$code_report"
```
This has some profound ramifications. every param here should and could for the most part be generated by the planner. even the
prompts, though any of these can be overridden by the user if they want.

When I was thinking about this, this made me realize that flags from cli does not always map to `node.set_params()`, it can also be
to the shared store. it also mean that the "magic" $ values like $code_report, $commit_message etc needs to be mapped to the shared
store automatically by the planner. Note that in the target flow above I've just put all the params there for clarity (as if it was
overwritten by the user). Perhaps there could also be a way to inspect the shared store values and overridden params like this for
the user.
