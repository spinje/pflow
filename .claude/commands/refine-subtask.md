Refine subtask $ARGUMENTS using the epistemic refinement workflow.

**FOUNDATION** (required reading in order):
1. **Mindset**: Read `.taskmaster/workflow/epistemic-manifesto.md` to understand the epistemic approach
2. **System**: Read `.taskmaster/workflow/workflow-overview.md` to see how subtask refinement connects to the main task workflow
3. **Execution**: Read and follow `.taskmaster/workflow/refine-subtask.md` for specific steps

This reading order ensures you understand WHY before learning HOW.

**Returning users**: If you've already internalized the epistemic approach, jump directly to `.taskmaster/workflow/refine-subtask.md`

**YOUR POSITION in the workflow:**
You are at the SUBTASK REFINEMENT stage (see diagram in workflow-overview.md):
- **Before you**: Main task was decomposed and project context created
- **You handle**: Subtask Knowledge Loading → Subtask Refinement
- **Your output enables**: Implementation phase (creates ready-for-implementation marker)

Key outputs in `.taskmaster/tasks/task_X/subtask_$ARGUMENTS/refinement/`:
- `knowledge-synthesis.md`
- `evaluation.md`
- `refined-spec.md`
- `cookbook-patterns.md` (for PocketFlow tasks)
- Create marker: `ready-for-implementation`

Always READ the project context from parent task first!
