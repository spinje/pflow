Great, lets create a task-review.md file in the .taskmaster/tasks/task_24/ folder. You should ultrathink and make a detailed
  plan of how we should structure this report for maximum clarity and impact. This report is going to be read by AI agents
  wanting to know what was done in task 24 when doing implementation of other tasks. We need to have this in mind and for example
   describe every intersection point that every change that we made has had on other modules and components in the system. We
  should consider the impact this has on the overall system design and how it fits in with the rest of the codebase. THis is just
   an example, im sure you will have lots of ideas how to structure this document to maximize its efficiency. Remember: create a
  plan first, then when you feel done! Create the task-review!

  Great, a task-review.md file has been created here: .taskmaster/tasks/task_20/task_20.md. But we should make it even better, you should ultrathink and make a detailed
  plan of how we should structure this report for maximum clarity and impact. What sections we should improve? What sections we should add? What sections we should remove? What sections we should modify?This report is going to be read by AI agents
