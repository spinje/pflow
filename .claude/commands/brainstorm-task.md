Right now we have a couple of documents that should guide us in the right direction. Start by reading .taskmaster/workflow/epistemic-manifesto.md to get into the right mindset. Then think hard and read these documents, remember there might be ambiguity and unverified assumptions in these files. Our job is to work through them and to make it crystal clear exactly what this feature should be and how it should be implemented.
