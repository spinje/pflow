Implement subtask $ARGUMENTS following the epistemic implementation workflow.

**FOUNDATION** (required reading in order):
1. **Mindset**: Read `.taskmaster/workflow/epistemic-manifesto.md` to understand the epistemic approach
2. **System**: Read `.taskmaster/workflow/workflow-overview.md` to understand the compound learning effect and how implementation captures feed future tasks
3. **Execution**: Read and follow `.taskmaster/workflow/implement-subtask.md` for specific steps

This reading order ensures you understand WHY before learning HOW.

**Returning users**: If you've already internalized the epistemic approach, jump directly to `.taskmaster/workflow/implement-subtask.md`

**YOUR POSITION in the workflow:**
You are at the IMPLEMENTATION stage (see diagram in workflow-overview.md):
- **Before you**: Task decomposed, subtask refined with clear specifications
- **You handle**: Implementation → Learning Capture (including real-time pattern/pitfall extraction)
- **Your output feeds**: Task review and future knowledge base

Prerequisites:
- Subtask must be refined (check for `ready-for-implementation` marker)
- Read refined specification first

Key outputs in `.taskmaster/tasks/task_X/subtask_$ARGUMENTS/implementation/`:
- `implementation-plan.md`
- `progress-log.md` (update continuously!)
- `subtask-review.md`
- If final subtask: create `task-review.md`

Remember: Capture learnings IN REAL-TIME for compound effect!
