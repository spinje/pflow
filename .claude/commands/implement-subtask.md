Implement subtask $ARGUMENTS following the epistemic implementation workflow.

**CRITICAL**: Read and follow the complete workflow in `.taskmaster/workflow/implement-subtask.md`

Prerequisites:
- Subtask must be refined (check for `ready-for-implementation` marker)
- Read refined specification first

Key activities:
- Create implementation plan
- Maintain real-time progress log
- Extract patterns/pitfalls as you discover them
- Create comprehensive review when complete
- If final subtask: create task-review.md

Files you'll create in `.taskmaster/tasks/task_X/subtask_$ARGUMENTS/implementation/`:
- `implementation-plan.md`
- `progress-log.md` (update continuously!)
- `subtask-review.md`

Remember: Capture learnings IN REAL-TIME for compound effect!
